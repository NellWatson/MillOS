# MillOS Launch Audit — Owner Decisions Required

_Branch `launch-audit-polish`. This supersedes the earlier version of this file. Everything under
"What was fixed this session" is committed and was reconciled green (typecheck + lint + format +
production build + 1199 tests) at each batch. Everything under "Decisions required" was deliberately
NOT auto-applied: it is outward-facing, hard to reverse, a product/legal/architecture call, or can
only be verified by looking at the running app (this audit harness has **no working WebGL**, so any
3D-render-behavioral change is marked "behavior-unverified")._

_Three audit passes have now run on this branch: the original deep/gap audit (batches A–C), a
structured 12-lane audit (batches D–E), and this session's third pass (a local WebGPU AI feature
found in-tree + committed, then Phase A high-value fixes, a seeded 12-lane completeness sweep
(batch F), and Phase C — the verifiable-safe deferred backlog)._

---

## Round 7 — SCADA render loop ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED + verified (the Round 6 "known follow-up")

The intermittent "Maximum update depth" loop is fixed. It was **not** a SCADA bug at all — it was in
`src/components/ui-new/GameInterface.tsx`.

**Root cause:** the `I` and `O` keyboard shortcuts toggle `showAIPanel` and `showSCADAPanel`
*independently* (useKeyboardShortcuts.ts:201/213 — no mutual exclusion), so pressing `I` then `O`
makes **both true**. GameInterface had two effects, each keyed on `[<flag>, activeMode]`, that
unconditionally forced `activeMode` to their own mode. With both flags true, effect A drove
`activeMode -> 'ai'` and effect B -> `'scada'`, each re-firing the other through the `activeMode`
dependency -> an infinite ping-pong. (The camera presets in my earlier repros were a red herring —
just render jitter that widened the both-true window; the real trigger is `I`+`O`.)

**Fix:** each effect now depends ONLY on its own flag and uses a functional `setActiveMode`, so it
reacts to a flag *change* once instead of fighting over `activeMode`. No feedback between the two
effects; the last-opened panel wins.

**Verified (deterministic before/after):** a clean repro — open AI (`I`), then SCADA (`O`), leave both
open for 18s — produced **43** "Maximum update depth" bursts before the fix and **0** after. Panels
still open/switch correctly (AI via keyboard ✓ and dock ✓; SCADA last-wins ✓). Full gate green
(typecheck/lint/prettier/1183 tests/build). Method note: the parallel diagnostic workflow's exhaustive
audit ruled out the unstable-`useSyncExternalStore` snapshots (dead code) and pointed at the
GameInterface panel-sync effects on the panel-cycling path; I verified the mechanism and fix directly.

---

## Round 6 — "3D environment not loading" (root-caused + fixed; working tree only, NOT committed)

**This was a real blocker, and the cause was Session B's font self-host (`ac93a5b`), not a GPU issue.**

**Root cause (proven, not guessed):** `SceneText` defaulted the 3D `<Text>` font to a self-hosted
`Inter-Regular.otf`. That file is a CFF/PostScript OpenType font, and troika-three-text's parser
throws on its CFF encoding (`unknown encoding format: 1`). Critically, troika's `doLoadFont` *swallows*
that parse error (it only `console.error`s — it never calls the load callback). drei's `<Text>`
(v10.7.7) **suspends** on the font via `suspend-react`, so that promise never resolves → every
`<Text>` stays suspended forever → the scene's `<Suspense fallback={null}>` never resolves → **the
entire 3D scene renders as `null`** while the DOM UI (dock/sidebar) stays up. The `SceneText` comment
claimed troika "falls back to the resolver — a safe failure mode"; that's false when `font` is set
explicitly (it hangs instead). One console error, blank 3D — exactly the symptom.

**Fix:** converted Inter to TrueType (`glyf`) outlines with fontTools cu2qu → `Inter-Regular.ttf`
(troika's native, reliable format; the repo's MedievalSharp.ttf already proved glyf parses).
Repointed `SceneText` at the `.ttf`, deleted the broken `.otf`, and corrected the misleading comment
to warn that the bundled font MUST be glyf/TTF (a CFF OTF hangs the whole scene).

**Verified end-to-end** (forced software WebGL / SwiftShader so the scene renders headless):
canvas initializes (640×400), **loading screen dismisses**, scene mounts, `FontFace` parses the TTF,
and the console is **clean — zero font errors**. typecheck/lint/prettier/**1183 tests**/build all green.

> **You may need a hard refresh** (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear your browser's cache of the old `.otf`
> and, if a service worker is registered, clear site data / unregister it (DevTools → Application).

### ⚠️ Separate finding (NOT from my edits, NOT fixed): intermittent SCADA render loop
While stress-testing, opening the **SCADA panel** after rapidly switching camera presets + other panels
produced bursts of React "Maximum update depth exceeded" (a `setState`-in-effect loop). It is
**intermittent and sequence-dependent** — opening SCADA alone produced zero errors — which points at a
`useSyncExternalStore`/subscription race in `src/scada/useSCADA.ts` (the `useSCADAAlarms` suppressed-
alarms effect and the machine-sync effect are the suspects), not a deterministic bug. I did **not**
touch SCADA code in any round, so this is pre-existing. I left it unfixed rather than apply a
speculative patch to a 1,558-line panel for a race I can't reliably reproduce — flagging it for a
focused follow-up with a dedicated repro. Say the word and I'll chase it down.

---

## Round 5 — "fix all issues" (executed on your call; working tree only, NOT committed)

You approved deleting the dead shell + orphans (keeping the 9 stranded widgets), and asked to fix
everything. All green: typecheck ✓, eslint ✓ (0), prettier ✓, **1183/1183 tests** ✓ (down 17 = the
deleted UIOverlay test), production build ✓, and **e2e boot smoke ✓ — 5/5** against the live ui-new
dock. Net this round: 52 files changed, +954/−524, 7 files deleted.

### Dead UI removed (~5,000 LOC)
- Deleted `UIOverlay.tsx` (the legacy 2,152-line shell ui-new replaced) + its test, and the 5
  fully-orphaned `ui/` widgets (`CollapsibleLegend`, `EmergencyControlPanel`, `WeatherControlPanel`,
  `GraphicsSettingsPanel`, `AlertAcknowledgmentFlow`). Updated the `ui/index.ts` barrel.
- **Kept** the 9 stranded widgets (`PredictiveMaintenancePanel`, `SafetyAnalyticsPanel`,
  `KeyboardShortcutsModal`, `MillClockDisplay`, `SafetyMetricsDisplay`, `SafetyConfigPanel`,
  `IncidentHistoryPanel`, `ZoneCustomizationPanel`, `TruckScheduleWidget`) for a later re-home into
  ui-new panels — they're now orphaned-but-compiling. **A re-home decision is still open** (see below).

### Remaining defects fixed (the Round-4 report-only list + the 4 AmbientDetails findings)
- **AmbientDetails** ×4: undisposed Cobweb/OilPuddle/RainPuddle geometries (leak); `Math.random()` in
  JSX re-rolling OilPuddle/RainPuddle rotation + StuckGum radius on every render (hoisted to stable
  useMemo); `scale` prop on `<sphereGeometry>` (ignored by R3F) moved onto the parent mesh for the
  Mouse body + StuckGum; MothSwarm flapped body+one-wing — now flaps both wings, body still.
- **productionStore throughput** — added a packer-only flow accumulator (`currentPackerFlowRate`) in
  materialFlowStore and drove the headline bags/hour from it; the old all-stage `currentFlowRate`
  triple-counted mill+sifter+packer and inflated the KPI ~3×.
- **workerPortraits** — fallback now an inline neutral SVG data-URI (can't 404); the referenced
  `default_avatar.webp` never existed.
- **PAAnnouncementSystem** — re-keyed icon switch to the real `Announcement.type` union
  (`info|warning|success|emergency`); the old keys (`shift_change|safety|production`) never matched.
- **UnifiedGameTick** — machine temperature kept at 0.1°C resolution instead of integer-rounded with a
  0.1 floor that froze it a full degree below the 75°C target.
- **AIDecisionVoting** — an approved multiplayer team vote now actually commits the decision to the
  production store (was UI-only).
- Plus: **ProductionMetrics** stable 5s sampling interval (was torn down on every metric change);
  **StabilityMonitor** clamps the displayed % (was showing negative); **machineTextures** disposes the
  raced JPG fallback; **KnowledgeEntryCard** flushes a table that's the article's final block (was
  dropped); **MultiplayerLobby** guards `navigator.clipboard` (threw in insecure contexts);
  **useAudioReactive** disconnects its AnalyserNode on cleanup (leak); **CameraController** guards
  `e.key` + reuses a vector instead of per-frame `.clone()`; **WorkerSystem** memoizes the active-alert
  filter (was per-worker per-frame); **types.ts** worker `targetMachine` ghosts (`mill-1.5`/`sifter-0`
  → `rm-102`/`sifter-a`); **MaintenanceSystem** cough puff starts at the right scale (no 1-frame pop);
  **hypothesisEngine** checks no-evidence before the refuted branch (latent).

### e2e fixed
- `e2e/ai-command-center.spec.ts` rewritten against the ui-new Dock (was targeting the deleted
  UIOverlay testids — and the suite's port-3000 server is Grafana on this machine). Added stable
  data-testids (`ai-command-center`, `ai-cpu-value`, `ai-memory-value`, `ai-decisions-count`) to the
  embedded AICommandCenter; the spec dismisses the first-run onboarding modal, opens the panel from the
  dock, and asserts metric formats. **Note:** the repo `playwright.config.ts` still points at port
  3000 — leave/repoint per your environment; I ran the suite against a free port to verify.

### Still open for you
1. **Commit** — same three-author tree caveat; nothing committed. Round 4 + Round 5 fixes + Session A/B
   WIP are all interleaved in the working tree. Say the word and I'll split clean logical commits.
2. **Re-home the 9 stranded widgets** into ui-new panels (predictive maintenance, safety analytics,
   keyboard-shortcuts help look genuinely worth keeping), or delete them too.
3. **The 9 un-run swarm dimension sweeps** still need the spend limit raised (`resumeFromRunId:
   wf_bae7e912-ec4`).

---

## Round 4 — full code + 3D-scene defect audit (massively parallel swarm + inline fixes; working tree only, NOT committed)

You asked for everything — code, assets, placements, models — to be checked for errors. A 109-agent
workflow ran: 3 spatial-ground-truth extractors (building AABBs, live machine world positions, 34
pathfinding obstacles, parent-group offsets), 29 area + 13 dimension finders + a diff-verifier, then
dedup and adversarial verification. 63 raw findings → 62 deduped → every critical/high/medium
verified (swarm-verified or re-verified inline by me against the live tree). **All fixes below are in
the working tree, deliberately uncommitted — see Decision 1.**

### Fixed — critical
- **MaintenanceSystem.tsx** — SlipEffect/CoughEffect called the *throwing* `useMaintenanceAnimation()`
  while mounted OUTSIDE the provider (via WorkerReactionOverlay in WorkerSystem). On ultra quality, a
  grain-spill/dust chaos reaction crashed the render and unwound to the app-level ErrorBoundary,
  killing the whole 3D scene. Both components were already built for a null context (fallback
  useFrame); switched them to the nullable `useContext` read.

### Fixed — high
- **InstancedSilos.tsx** — distance-culled silo bodies only un-culled inside the
  `vibrating && running && fill>50` guard: any idle/stopped/≤50%-fill silo vanished PERMANENTLY after
  the camera panned away and back. Body matrix now always restored on the visible path; matrix flush
  no longer gated on vibration. **InstancedPackers.tsx** had the same class (idle packer spouts) — fixed.
- **ScenarioPlayground.tsx** — the results/grade screen was unreachable: the store ends a scenario by
  clamping `currentTime` AND flipping `isPlaying:false` in one atomic set, but the completion check
  lived inside an `isPlaying`-gated effect. Moved to its own effect. Also fixed the tick-delta leak
  (mount-to-start/pause time made scenarios jump forward, sometimes completing on the first tick).
- **materialFlowStore.ts** — mass-conservation leak: parcels arriving at a full destination buffer were
  destroyed while `currentLoad` kept their weight, ratcheting up until the conveyor stalled FOREVER.
  Remainders now stay on the belt and retry; jams back up and recover.
- **CascadeVisualization.tsx** — re-keyed to the live machine ids (`silo-0..4`, `sifter-a/b/c`,
  `packer-0..2`; your 03:12 pass fixed the mill count but the legacy id scheme remained), replaced the
  fuzzy substring load-match (`pack-line-1` was reading **silo-1**'s load; silos resolved to nothing)
  with exact-id lookup, corrected packer positions (±8, was ±12).
- **InstancedVillageComponents.tsx** — village lamp glass vanished after the first day/night toggle:
  the isNight-keyed material passed through `args` remounted the InstancedMesh (zeroing instanceMatrix)
  while the matrix-population effect never re-ran. Material now attached as a child primitive.

### Fixed — medium
- **Environment.tsx** ×2 — splash velocity/life buffers sized to the mount-time quality wrote NaN into
  geometry when quality was raised mid-session (now allocated at max=50); rain RENDERED on medium but
  was excluded from ANIMATION (frozen rain in mid-air — gate now excludes only low).
- **TruckBay.tsx** — truck position used `clock.elapsedTime` while lights/doors recomputed state from
  `performance.now()` (offset by page-load→canvas-start): collapsed to one clock via state refs.
- **ForkliftSystem.tsx** — in physics mode (the default) `isStopped`/`isInCrossing` were never updated:
  wheels spun on frozen forklifts, warning lights never went red in drills, the safety horn/metric
  never fired. Derived `effectiveStopped` from the signals physics mode honors. (Known gap: PhysicsForklift's
  internal proximity stops still aren't surfaced — needs a stopped-callback, flagged below.)
- **VisibleChaos.tsx** — grain-spill main pile rendered with cone radius `0.8 * scaleRef.current` read
  at render time (ref starts 0 → permanently invisible). Pile now animated via object scale.
- **StatusRing.tsx** / **HoloLabel.tsx** / **DataFlowLine.tsx** / **FarmArea.tsx** — GPU resource leaks
  (materials/geometries recreated without disposal; DataFlowLine also rebuilt its `THREE.Line` every render).
- **TruckScheduleWidget.tsx** — "arriving soon" amber compared SECONDS against a 15-MINUTE-era
  threshold (fired only in the last 15s). Now `15 * 60`.
- **flourishingStore.ts** — tick mutated worker objects in place under a shallow copy; per-worker
  subscribers never re-rendered. Now builds fresh per-worker objects.
- **GPUResourceManager.ts** — `${type}s` produced `"geometrys"` vs the `geometries` stats key: geometry
  memory stats were permanently 0. Explicit singular→plural map.
- **DecisionPathRings.tsx** — attention ring hardcoded Y=0.2, rendering ~9 units below elevated sifters.

### Fixed — low (safe/isolated only)
- **SkySystem.tsx** CityLights could never render (early return meant the points the night-manager
  drives never mounted); **Fireflies.tsx** latched on after their first night (frozen + glowing all
  day); **WorkerBillboard.tsx** far-LOD workers floated 0.39 units and were ~30% short, with hardcoded
  light skin tone (now uses `appearance.skinTone` like the other LODs); **ConveyorSystem.tsx** roller
  count now derived from belt length (13 fixed rollers overhung your new 38-unit central spine belt by
  up to 12 units; main belt keeps exactly 13); **PhysicsConfig.ts** fire-drill exit sensors could
  NEVER fire (Rapier needs both filters to accept: worker filter lacked SENSOR) — evacuation still
  worked via the distance path, but the physics sensors were dead weight.

### ⚠️ Disclosure — two workflow agents edited files (against instructions; both edits validated and kept)
Verifier agents were read-only by instruction, but two applied their fixes before dying:
**WorkerMoodOverlay.tsx** (tab-refocus delta cap, 6000ms — correctly mirrors the 2000ms cap scaled to
the 5s tick; prevents safety/flourishing values cratering on refocus) and
**SafetyEquipment.tsx** (`hasPost={false}` on the Zone 2/3 signs whose new floor posts would have
speared the central spine conveyor). I verified both for correctness AND completeness, and checked the
remaining posted signs (Zone 1 z=-25, Zone 4 z=28) land clear of silos/packers/belts.

### Report-only (real, deliberately not edited)
- `productionStore.ts:770` headline throughput consumes the combined mill+sifter+packer flow rate as if
  it were final packer output (inflated KPI) — needs a packer-only accumulator; metric-semantics call.
- `utils/workerPortraits.ts:33` falls back to `/assets/workers/default_avatar.webp` which **does not
  exist** (404/broken image for unknown ids) — needs an actual asset created.
- **AmbientDetails.tsx** (your WIP file; 4 verified lows left untouched): undisposed useMemo
  geometries; `Math.random()` in returned JSX re-randomizing on re-render; `scale` prop on
  `<sphereGeometry>` silently ignored by R3F; MothSwarm flaps the wrong child indices (right wing
  never animates).
- Smaller verified/likely items: UIOverlay 500ms stale machine metrics on switch; ProductionMetrics
  interval churn; PAAnnouncementSystem icon switch keyed on never-stored types; CollapsibleLegend first-drag
  jump; StabilityMonitor negative %; machineTextures JPG/KTX2 race leak; KnowledgeEntryCard drops a
  final markdown table; MultiplayerLobby unguarded clipboard; AIDecisionVoting approved votes never
  apply; UnifiedGameTick temperature rounding freeze; useAudioReactive analyser never disconnected;
  `types.ts` roster `targetMachine` ghosts (`mill-1.5`, `sifter-0`, display-only); WorkerSystem
  per-frame alert `.filter`; CameraController keydown guard + per-frame `.clone()`;
  hypothesisEngine status-branch ordering (latent, method uncalled).
- Completeness critic: `src/animation/` and `src/protocols/vcp/` (20+ files of pure logic-math) were
  covered by no scope; `vcp/memory/outcomeTracker.ts` has visible divide-by-length smells.

### Decisions required (3)
1. **Commit strategy.** The working tree now interleaves THREE authors: your placement pass (incl. the
   03:12 rm-105/106 propagation), Session B's 4 deferred font-swap files, and this round's ~25 fix
   files. I did NOT commit anything (same reason Round 3 didn't). Happy to split into clean logical
   commits on your word, or you can review-and-commit wholesale.
2. **The monthly spend limit killed ~52 of 109 swarm agents mid-run** ("You've hit your monthly spend
   limit"). Every dropped critical/high/medium was re-verified inline, and the **asset-paths sweep was
   completed deterministically inline** (every `/assets|models|textures|sounds|portraits|hdri|draco|libs|fonts`
   reference + dynamic builders diffed against `public/`: the ONLY missing referenced asset is
   `default_avatar.webp`; draco/basis decoders, SceneText font, machine-texture trees, and all
   portrait/worker webps resolve). **9 dimension sweeps never ran**: inside-building, z-fighting,
   resource-dispose, shader-cachekey, NaN-geometry, react-hooks, null-safety, logic-math, and the
   uncommitted-diff verifier. If you raise the limit, the run resumes cheaply
   (`resumeFromRunId: wf_bae7e912-ec4` — completed agents return cached).
3. **Is your placement session still open?** Its last edit was 03:13 (the mill-count propagation).
   Everything here was written assuming it might wake; nothing of yours was reverted or committed.

_Validation: full gate run GREEN after all Round 4 fixes — typecheck ✓, eslint ✓ (0 problems),
prettier ✓, **1200/1200 tests** ✓, production build ✓ (10.95s). **Boot smoke ✓**: Playwright Chromium
against a dev server serving the fixed tree boots to the full UI — status bar, navigation dock,
alerts, **60 FPS** with the 3D scene live. Machine-readable artifacts: `_audit/round1_results.json`
(16 swarm-verified findings + spatial map + critic) and `_audit/round1_unverified.json` (the 42
findings whose verifiers the spend limit killed; all crit/high/medium among them were re-verified
inline before fixing)._

_⚠️ Two environment/test-infra findings from the smoke run (pre-existing, not from this round's
fixes): (1) **the e2e suite cannot run as configured** — Playwright targets port 3000, which on this
machine is occupied by **Grafana** (and 3100 by a Docker forward), so it tested Grafana's login page;
(2) run on a free port, the app boots fine but **all 6 `e2e/ai-command-center.spec.ts` tests fail on
stale selectors** — `ai-panel-toggle`/`ai-cpu-value` testids exist only in the legacy `UIOverlay.tsx`,
while the rendered ui-new Dock ("AI Command" aria-label) and redesigned panel have none of them.
Rewriting the spec needs your call on which UI surface is canonical for e2e (`ui/` vs `ui-new/`) —
add it to Decision 1's review or tell me and I'll rewrite the spec._

---

## Round 3 — executed the recommendation brief you approved (committed, gated green)

Build + 1200 tests + boot smoke green. Three commits:
- **Deleted** CelebrationSystem (+ConfettiBurst), CrisisEventSystem (+CrisisEffects), MissionControl
  (`e7f6e43`) — broken/redundant/overlapping per the per-component investigation.
- **Removed the internal Asset Prototype Deck** from the production build + **deleted the orphaned
  truckbay model cluster** (~1500 LOC) (`dda4fbd`).
- **Self-hosted the 3D `<Text>` font** via a `SceneText` wrapper defaulting to a local
  `Inter-Regular.otf` — removes the last unconditional third-party connection (jsDelivr glyph fetch)
  (`ac93a5b`).

**⚠️ Concurrent-edit collision — left for you (NOT committed by me):** while I worked you were editing
the tree (RM-105/106 → 4 mills, central spine conveyor, dock-opening dims, crane position, worker
spawns, pallet/shower placement). My font codemod's one-line `<Text>` import swap landed on **4 files
you're mid-edit on** — `ConveyorSystem`, `MillScene`, `FactoryExterior`, `TruckBay` — so I did **not**
commit them (I can't cleanly split my swap from your edits without interactive staging). They + your 5
standalone edits (`AmbientDetails`, `SafetyEquipment`, `types.ts`, `InstancedPlansifters`,
`ProductionFlowVisualization`) remain in your working tree. When you commit those 4, my import swaps
ride along and the font self-host reaches 23/23.

**Still yours:** the legal `[CONFIRM]` values (controller identity, liability cap, effective date,
min-age); and removing `cdn.jsdelivr.net` from the CSP once you confirm 3D labels render in a real
browser (kept for now as troika's safe fallback). The CelebrationSystem `achievementsStore` is kept as
a foundation if you ever want a real achievements UI.

---

## Round 2 — actioned from your "fix these" decisions (committed, gated green)

You answered: canonical host = **www**, product name = **BAMS**, governing law = **England & Wales**,
disconnected features = **investigate each**, plus "fix" the dead-code batch / ownership→friction /
scada-proxy. Done:

- **Disconnected features** (16-agent per-component investigation → my own verification):
  - **Deleted 11 orphaned/superseded components** (`1ad81f2`): ComplianceDashboard (superseded by live
    SCADAPanel), SPCCharts, ShiftHandover (≠ live ShiftHandoverSummary), ShiftBriefing,
    PreferenceRequestWidget, AssetShowcase, ManagementStylePanel, MillSceneMinimal, VillageAreaOptimized,
    FarmAreaInstances, SmartForklift. + cleaned the dead uiStore SPC toggle.
  - **Kept** (the L11 "dead" flags were false positives): WorkerMoodOverlay (live at WorkerSystem:1336),
    InstancedVillageComponents (VillageArea uses its InstancedLamps).
  - **Flagged, NOT wired** (see "Still needs you" below): CelebrationSystem, CrisisEventSystem, MissionControl.
- **Dead-code utilities** — deleted 8 orphaned files, ~3000 LOC (`58584f5`): gpuManagement(+geometryMerger,
  lodIntegration, objectPool), pathfinding, truckPath, workerBehaviorEngine, apiSecurity.
- **ownership→friction**: activated the silently-dead integration (static import) + made its tests
  deterministic (`4b06b2a`).
- **Canonical host → www.millos.net** across og:/canonical/twitter/img-src (`e3765ad`).
- **BAMS naming**: all *user-facing* strings already read BAMS (Phase C); the remaining "BAS" are internal
  code identifiers/types (out of scope to rename — high risk, zero user benefit). No change needed.
- **scada-proxy criticals** (`2c7eb4b`): env-var dual-read (`SCADA_API_KEY ?? API_KEY`), constant-time key
  compare ×2, and **`npm audit` → 0 vulnerabilities** (jsrsasign CRITICAL, express-rate-limit/minimatch HIGH).
- **Legal drafts**: filled England & Wales governing law + `nell@ethicsnet.com` contact (`c4c6ec6`).

### Still needs you (deliberately not auto-done — would crash, is redundant, or needs your value)
- **CelebrationSystem (achievements):** complete + valuable, but it renders a fragment mixing an R3F
  `<points>` particle system (ConfettiBurst) **and** DOM `<motion.div>` — mounting it as-is **crashes**
  ("R3F hooks outside Canvas"). Wiring needs a deliberate split (confetti → into the Canvas; milestone
  overlay → into the DOM tree) + a real-browser check. I left its internal interval-bug fix in place so it
  works *once split & wired*.
- **CrisisEventSystem (+CrisisEffects):** complete crisis mechanic, needs Canvas wiring — **wire-in or delete?**
- **MissionControl:** complete sidebar widget but **redundant** with the live OverviewPanel (efficiency/
  priorities/alerts) — likely delete, your call.
- **truckbay model cluster (~1500 LOC):** still imported by the prototype deck (AssetPrototypePage); delete it
  together with the prototype-deck decision (below).
- **gameSimulationStore briefing methods** (`startShiftBriefing`/`completeShiftBriefing` + `'briefing'` phase):
  now dead after deleting ShiftBriefing — safe to trim, but it touches the live shift state-machine, so I left
  it for your eyeball.
- **scada-proxy:** WS auth still accepts the key via URL query (leaks into logs); moving it to a subprotocol/
  short-lived token needs a coordinated SCADAPanel (frontend) change.
- **Legal `[CONFIRM]`:** controller legal identity (you-as-individual vs a company), liability cap, effective
  date, `<Text>` 3D-font self-host (removes the last jsDelivr connection), optional min-age line.

---

## What was fixed this session (committed, gated green)

### `feat(ai)` — local WebGPU AI backend (commit `6454b86`) — **NEEDS YOUR SIGN-OFF**
A complete, working on-device strategic-AI backend (Qwen3-4B via `@mlc-ai/web-llm`) was found
**uncommitted in your working tree** at the start of this session. I validated it green
(typecheck + lint + build + 1199 tests) and committed it as one atomic, isolated unit — I did **not**
author it. It adds an alternative to the Gemini API: no API key, no per-token cost, no data leaves
the device after a one-time weight download.
- **This is a product decision only you can make.** It adds a dependency, ships **GB of model
  weights** to the browser on opt-in, and widens the CSP to `huggingface.co` / `*.hf.co` /
  `raw.githubusercontent.com`. A branch commit is not shipping — review before merge.
- **It does NOT resolve the Gemini model-ID launch-blocker below.** The default backend is still
  `gemini` → the deprecated model string. WebGPU is opt-in only.

### Phase A — high-value verifiable fixes
- **GDPR: self-hosted Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts and the DRACO decoder** (`228b9d8`). Removes the
  only **unconditional** third-party connections on page load: the Google Fonts `<link>` (sent every
  visitor's IP to Google US before any interaction) and the gstatic DRACO decoder (fired on plain
  page load via the default-scene worker/forklift GLBs). Fonts are now vite-bundled from
  `src/assets/fonts/`; the decoder is served from `public/draco/` via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
  CSP tightened: dropped `fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`, `www.gstatic.com`.
  _Verify fonts render in a real browser; fallback to system-ui is graceful if a face is missing._
- **Three dead scene-logic bugs** (`cba614d`):
  - `InstancedPlansifters` — sifter bodies + hanger rods never rendered on **LOW** quality (the
    `useFrame` bailed on a null `flywheelRef`, but the flywheel mesh isn't rendered on LOW). **LIVE
    component** (rendered by `Machines.tsx`); fix is real. Behavior-unverified (no WebGL here).
  - `MoodAura` — auras never registered their material after a null first render (frozen). **LIVE**
    (rendered by `WorkerPersonalityLayer`); fix is real. Behavior-unverified.
  - `CelebrationSystem` — fixed the achievement-tracking `setInterval` (churning deps re-created it
    faster than its 60 s period, so it never fired). **HONEST CORRECTION:** this component is
    **orphaned (zero importers — never mounted)**, so the fix makes the code correct but does **not**
    by itself revive achievements. The real question is product wiring — see "Disconnected features".
- **CI: gate the Pages deploy on typecheck + lint + test** (`51645d3`) — `deploy.yml` ran with no
  validation, so a broken push to `main` published straight to production.
- **Repo-wide prettier format** (`5fab3d8`) — cleared pre-existing format drift across ~16 files
  plus the WebGPU files (committed from WIP without a format pass). `format:check` is now clean.

### Phase B — third-pass completeness sweep (commit `d77a06d`)
A seeded 12-lane sweep (32 agents) found 34 items; **17 verifiable-new fixes** were applied, each
diff-reviewed by me and reconciled green:
- **Multiplayer host-authority (partial):** the host now **drops inbound `MACHINE_LOCK` from guests**
  (only the host legitimately sends them; guests use INTENT — verified zero legit impact, blocks
  lock-spoofing) and validates peer-supplied `selectedMachineId` against the machine registry.
- **`geminiClient`:** guard empty/null model output before caching; tighten token-budget estimate.
- **`StatusRing`:** `useMemo`-with-side-effects → `useEffect` (off the render path; ≤1-frame
  status-color lag, behavior-unverified).
- **`MQTTAdapter`:** bounds-check topic length before slicing untrusted publish frames.
- **`MobilePanel`** multiplayer dock icon; **`VotingPanel`** visible focus ring; **`index.html`**
  CSP-consumer documentation.

### Phase C — verifiable-safe deferred backlog (commit `56ea99a`)
A file-partitioned sweep over the 170-item deferred backlog (79 files, 158 agents). I applied only
the verifiable-safe subset, diff-reviewed each, and reconciled green (typecheck + lint + format +
build + **1203 tests** — +4 from a new alarm-archive test):
- **a11y (L5):** WCAG-AA contrast (`text-slate-500`→`400`) across 7 panels; visible focus rings;
  region/list/heading semantics.
- **UX (L6):** destructive-action confirmations (Zone/Graphics/Incident/Safety panels, Mobile,
  MultiplayerLobby); Escape / outside-tap dismiss; touch-visible delete; negative-radius clamp.
- **perf (L9):** reference-check BAS subscription (drop per-mutation `JSON.stringify`); heat-map
  short-circuit when off; single-copy bounded readings append; allocation-free collision check.
- **error-handling (L4):** MQTT settle-once connect; WebSocket connection-state listener; PeerJS
  explicit reconnect; multiplayer intent-timeout sweep.
- **correctness (L1):** invalid `scale` prop relocation; FocusIndicator mount-toggle
  (behavior-unverified); SCADA alarm-archive dedup (+ test).
- **config (L12):** deploy.yml rsync-excludes nested version dirs; release.yml git-cliff
  `keepachangelog`; prototype-deck CSP parity.
- **REVERTED — `src/stores/stabilityStore.ts`** (`require()`→`import`): the fix is technically
  correct but it **revives the dead worker-ownership→friction integration, changing gameplay
  balance** and breaking 6 tests that assert current behavior. Left as-is; see "Decisions required"
  below — it's an owner call, not blind polish.

### Runtime boot smoke (production preview + agent-browser)
Booted the production build under the real meta-CSP: React mounts, stores initialize, AI engine
starts, procedural textures generate. **Zero CSP violations** — confirms the Google-Fonts + DRACO +
gstatic CSP removals are safe at runtime (any residual request would have logged a `Refused`
violation; there were none, and the Google Fonts `<link>` is gone). WebGL context could not be
created in this harness (SwiftShader `BindToCurrentSequence failed`) — a **harness GPU limitation,
not a regression** (it fails at renderer creation, before any scene component runs; CSP does not
govern WebGL contexts). Consequently the 3D scene and all scene-render fixes remain
**behavior-unverified** — please click through them in a real browser (same caveat the prior passes
carried).

## ⛔ Decisions required

### 1. [CRITICAL] Gemini model ID — `src/utils/geminiClient.ts`
`model: 'gemini-3-flash-preview'` is **deprecated (as of 2025-12-17)** with `gemini-3.5-flash` named
as successor; the app uses the legacy `@google/generative-ai` SDK. **The default AI path still uses
this string** (WebGPU is opt-in and does not change the default). Live AI may be silently dead at
launch for users who add a key.
- **Decision:** swap to a verified-served model ID (smoke-test with your key via `listModels`), or
  migrate to `@google/genai`. In the same change, re-check the `GEMINI_FLASH_*_COST` constants and
  fix stale "Gemini 2.0 Flash"/"Flash 3" log strings. (I can't pick a model ID safely — my cutoff
  matches the SDK's, so any guess is itself the launch risk.)

### 2. [HIGH] Multiplayer host-authority — full redesign still needed
Phase B closed the `MACHINE_LOCK` spoof and added machine-id validation, but the core issue remains:
the host derives `playerId` from untrusted peer metadata (`MultiplayerManager.ts:~145`) and
`PLAYER_UPDATE` is accepted with an arbitrary `p.id`. A malicious peer can still impersonate/spoof
other players' position/selection. **Fix is one architectural unit** (a verified `peerId→playerId`
map + host-authoritative acceptance).
- **Decision:** do the host-authority redesign before promoting multiplayer, or ship it as
  "trusted friends / experimental."

### 3. [HIGH] Version switcher `public/v0.20/` + `v0.10/` (~418 MB)
`vite.config.ts` + `deploy.yml` deliberately serve `/v0.10/`, `/v0.20/`, `/v0.30/`, and a
version-switcher dropdown in the live UI points at them. Last deployed Pages artifact ≈ 1.27 GB
(over GitHub's 1 GB soft limit).
- **Decision:** is the switcher a launch feature? **Keep** → slim the snapshots (they don't need
  137 MB of MP3s each — `deploy.yml` copies music into every version). **Drop** → remove the
  dropdown options, the `v0.10`/`v0.20` copy steps, and the dirs.

### 4. [HIGH] Only 4 of 6 roller mills exist — `MillScene.tsx:~435`
`rm-105`/`rm-106` are referenced by 4 systems but never created (docs say RM-101…RM-106). Fixing it
changes layout, pathfinding, and gameplay — a design call.

### 5. [MEDIUM] Canonical host mismatch — `CNAME` = `www.millos.net`, but all `og:`/`canonical`/
`twitter:` URLs use the apex `https://millos.net/`. Pick one canonical host, make them agree, and
configure the apex↔www redirect, or social/SEO signals split.

### 6. [MEDIUM] Root `/` is a contentless meta-refresh redirect (`deploy.yml`) — crawlers/scrapers
hitting the canonical URL get no SEO/OG tags. Inline the full `<head>` into the redirect page, or
set canonical/og:url to `/v0.30/`.

### 7. [MEDIUM] Worker-ownership → friction integration is silently dead (`stabilityStore.ts`)
`getOwnershipFrictionMultiplier()` uses a CommonJS `require('./ownershipStore')` that **fails
silently in the ESM/Vite browser bundle**, so the intended "more worker ownership → less friction"
mechanic never runs (it always returns the 1.0 fallback). The one-line fix (static import) was
prepared and **reverted**, because activating it **changes gameplay balance** and breaks 6
`stabilityStore` tests that encode the current (integration-off) behavior.
- **Decision:** (a) activate it (static import) + rebalance + update the 6 tests, or (b) delete the
  dead `getOwnershipFrictionMultiplier` code if the mechanic is abandoned. Either is correct; both
  are your call, not a blind edit.

### 8. [LOW] Canonical product name — "BAS" vs "BAMS" vs "Bilateral Autonomy"
The bilateral-autonomy subsystem is referred to by all three names across the UI (e.g. a panel
header says "BAMS Timeline" while a sibling comment/README says "BAS"; `educationalContent` says
"BAMS"). Phase C made each panel internally consistent but could not pick the **app-wide canonical
name** — that's a branding call. **Decision:** choose one and I (or a follow-up sweep) will apply it
everywhere.

## Disconnected features (product-completeness question)

A cluster of substantial, **feature-shaped components are orphaned (zero importers — never mounted)**.
These are not just dead code; each is a launch question of "is this supposed to work?" The most
salient is the **achievement / celebration system** (`CelebrationSystem`, 528 LOC — I fixed its
internal bug, but it is unwired). Others:
- `ComplianceDashboard` (749 LOC), `CrisisEventSystem` (539 LOC), `SPCCharts` (813 LOC),
  `ShiftHandover` (322), `ShiftBriefing` (222), `PreferenceRequestWidget`, `WorkerMoodOverlay`,
  `MissionControl`, `AssetShowcase`, `ManagementStylePanel`, `MillSceneMinimal` (debug/fallback
  scene), `SmartForklift`.
- Perf-optimization alternates never adopted: `FarmAreaInstances` (815 LOC), `VillageAreaOptimized`
  (608 LOC), `InstancedVillageComponents`.
- **Decision per item:** wire it in (if it's a launch feature) or delete it (if shelved). Store
  actions used elsewhere must stay; only the unmounted components/exports are dead.

---

## Dead code — delete-on-confirm batch (~judgment call, NOT auto-deleted)

Pure dead code with zero importers, several carrying explicit `@ts-ignore "kept for future use"`
markers (which is why I did **not** auto-delete — that would override an explicit in-code intent):
- **`truckbay/` cluster (~1500 LOC):** `TruckModel`, `MergedTruckParts`, `TruckParts`,
  `TruckSmallParts`, `TruckAudio`, `TruckLogos` (+4 `@ts-ignore` components).
- **Orphaned utils:** `gpuManagement.ts` barrel + its exclusive consumers (`geometryMerger.ts`,
  `lodIntegration.ts`, `objectPool.ts`); `pathfinding.ts` (~660 LOC A*); `truckPath.ts`;
  `workerBehaviorEngine.ts`; `apiSecurity.ts` (648 LOC, fully unimported).
- **Unused exports:** `auditStore` (7 helpers), `aiBehaviorEngine` (several), `perfMonitor`,
  `terrain/useTerrainMaterial`, VCP unused decoder/encoder APIs (Rewind bridge — may be roadmap;
  add a round-trip test or remove).
- **`@ts-ignore`/`any`/commented blocks:** `FirstPersonController` (`any` ref),
  `environmentRegistry` (`any`), commented-out JSX in `TruckBay.tsx` / `VillageArea.tsx`.
- **Decision:** confirm none are planned-soon, then delete as one batch (`npm run build` verifies).

---

## Config (L12) — owner / install-risk

- **`@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64` is a direct dependency** (`package.json`) — a platform-specific
  native binary; as a hard dep it breaks `npm install` on Linux/Windows/CI (hence `npm ci --force`).
  Recommend removing it and dropping `--force`. Left as-is (dep-resolution changes need CI verify).
- **`public/sw.js`** activate handler deletes all `millos-*` caches, evicting other deployed
  versions; **`deploy.yml`** nests version dirs + MP3s inside `/v0.30/`; **`tailwind.config.js`** is
  an orphaned v3-style config (its `pulse-slow`/`spin-slow` animations may be relied on — verify
  before deleting); **`metadata.json`** is stray scaffolding (safe to delete); the **Asset Prototype
  Deck** ships as a production rollup input. _(The safe subset of these is handled in Phase C; the
  install-risk ones are flagged.)_

## scada-proxy (SEPARATE backend — NOT in the GitHub Pages launch)
Referenced only by `SCADAPanel.tsx`; deployed via its own Dockerfile/k8s, outside the frontend
gates. Audited, not modified. If you deploy it, these are serious:
- **[CRITICAL] Auth fails OPEN** — every endpoint, incl. `PUT /tags` (write-to-PLC), is
  unauthenticated when `SCADA_API_KEY` is unset.
- **[CRITICAL] Env var mismatch** — code reads `SCADA_API_KEY`; k8s/compose inject `API_KEY`.
- **[CRITICAL/HIGH] Dependency CVEs** — `jsrsasign`, `express-rate-limit 8.2.1`, `express 4.18.2`.
- Timing-unsafe key compare; API key accepted via URL query (leaks into logs); no write-rate-limit.

---

## Legal drafts (`_audit/legal_drafts/` — DRAFTS, nothing published)
Updated this session to reflect the GDPR fix: Google Fonts + the DRACO decoder are **now
self-hosted**, so the only remaining unconditional third-party connections are GitHub Pages (host)
and jsDelivr (troika 3D-text glyph fetch for unstyled `<Text>` — eliminable by giving `<Text>` a
local `font=`). SCADA-mode disclosure added.
- **Open `[OWNER DECISION]`s:** controller legal identity + contact, governing law/jurisdiction,
  liability cap, effective date, optional minimum-age line. (Drafts carry a "consult an attorney"
  disclaimer.)

---

## Remaining flagged (visual / subjective / scene-behavioral)
The deferred items NOT auto-fixed are mostly: subjective design-taste (L8 spacing/color/font-scale),
scene-behavioral perf/render changes needing in-app visual verification (L1/L9 `useFrame`), and UX
"add-a-confirmation" polish. Full per-lane list with concrete proposed patches:
`_audit/_deferred_by_lane.md`. Phase C applied the verifiable-safe subset; the rest remain flagged
because they need your eyes in the running app or your taste call, not a blind edit.

_Pre-existing, repo-wide, not launch-blocking: React 19 `MutableRefObject` and
`String.prototype.substr` deprecation hints (suggestion-level; a future codemod, not this pass)._
