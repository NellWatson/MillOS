/**
 * A whole-machine mutex for anything that renders.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two headless Chromium instances driving a WebGL scene on one
 * GPU do not fail. They each run at roughly half speed, and the frame rate that
 * then lands in the report is a measurement of the other process rather than of
 * the scene. This repository routinely fans out agents - `blind-ab-judge` and
 * `visual-fidelity-judge` are separate agent types, and the audit sweeps run
 * parallel workers - so concurrent captures are the normal case, not an edge
 * case. Without serialisation, `overview` failing its 55 FPS budget by 7 FPS is
 * indistinguishable from another agent holding the GPU.
 *
 * The related hazard the lock does NOT solve, and which callers must still
 * respect: comparing a measurement against a control taken at a different time
 * on a shared tree attributes every other change in between to yours. An A/B
 * must be one variable, ideally toggled at runtime in a single process.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const lock = await acquireCaptureLock('art-review');
 *   try { ... } finally { await lock.release(); }
