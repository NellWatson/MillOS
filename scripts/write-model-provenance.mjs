/**
 * Write `assets/source/models/{farm,village}/PROVENANCE.json` from the
 * normalization report, so provenance is generated rather than typed.
 *
 * Provenance that is hand-maintained drifts: the cow's file was accurate on the
 * day it was written and described one of thirty assets a day later. Everything
 * here is read from artefacts that the pipeline itself produced -
 * `test-results/assets/normalization.json` for hashes, scale factors and
 * measured bounds - or parsed out of `normalize-model-assets.mjs`'s own
 * `GENERATED_ASSETS` table for the size decisions.
 *
 * The table is IMPORTED rather than duplicated, on the same principle as
 * `validSceneNames()` in `capture-art-review.mjs`: a hand-copied list is a copy
 * that silently goes stale, and stale provenance is worse than none because it
 * reads as verified. The normalizer only runs its pass when invoked as a
 * command, so importing it here is side-effect free.
 *
 * Run after `npm run normalize-models`:
 *
 *   npm run provenance:models
 *
 * It reads only, apart from the two JSON files it writes, so it never touches a
 * GLB and cannot introduce the 4-byte forklift drift that re-running
 * normalization does.
