/**
 * Module reachability gate: which files under `src/` actually ship.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Pass 4 converted 129 materials across five interior rooms in
 * `src/components/infrastructure/FactoryWalls.tsx` on strong evidence - the
 * meshes carried `castShadow` and `receiveShadow`, which an unlit material can
 * never honour, so the author's intent was recorded right beside the material
 * that made it impossible. Every one of those edits was correct and every one of
 * them changed nothing, because nothing imports that file.
 *
 * The repo already knew about two other dead trees: `machineSurfaces.ts` has
 * named `components/Machines.tsx` and the `Instanced*.tsx` tree at its top for
 * two passes. What it did not have was a LIST, or a way to notice a new one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO INDEPENDENT SIGNALS, BECAUSE EITHER ALONE LIES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. THE IMPORT GRAPH says whether a path exists from the entry module. It is
 *    exact about edges and blind about tree-shaking: a barrel that re-exports a
 *    dead component still counts as an edge, so `infrastructure/index.ts`
 *    keeping `FactoryWalls` alive on the graph proves nothing about the build.
 *
 * 2. THE BUILD says what survived. A distinctive string literal from the file
 *    either appears in `dist/assets/` or it does not - which is exactly how pass
 *    4 finally established that `FactoryWalls.tsx` was dead ("SAFETY FIRST"
 *    appears nowhere in the build). It is blind in the other direction: a file
 *    whose only strings are shared with a dozen siblings cannot be tested this
 *    way, and a live file whose strings were all inlined into a caller reads as
 *    missing.
 *
 * Neither is sufficient. Agreement between them is the verdict; DISAGREEMENT IS
 * A FINDING - `shipped but unreachable` means this script's resolver missed an
 * edge and is lying about everything downstream of it, which is why that case
 * fails the gate rather than being filtered out.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT A MARKER STRING HAS TO SURVIVE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * esbuild keeps string literals verbatim but is free to re-quote and re-escape
 * them, and JSX text becomes a string literal in the output. So a marker is only
 * usable if it cannot be rewritten: no quotes, no backslashes, no newlines, no
 * `${`. Markers are additionally required to be UNIQUE ACROSS `src/` - a
 * Tailwind class list or a two-word label that six components share says nothing
 * about which of them shipped.
 *
 * UNIQUENESS IS SUBSTRING UNIQUENESS, NOT EQUALITY, and the first build of this
 * script got that wrong in the direction that matters. The search against
 * `dist/` is a substring search, so a marker only identifies its file if no
 * OTHER source file CONTAINS it. `Machines.tsx` - a file this repo has known to
 * be dead for two passes - was reported as shipping on the strength of
 * `text-[10px] text-red-400`, which is a substring of a longer className in the
 * very-much-live `VotingPanel.tsx`; `MultiplayerLobby.tsx` on `The host has left
 * the session.`, a prefix of the longer sentence in `HostMigration.ts`. Four
 * dead files were reported alive that way. Markers are therefore counted across
 * the whole concatenated source corpus, and a marker that occurs anywhere
 * outside its own file is discarded.
 *
 * The one collision this cannot see is a string the file shares with a BUNDLED
 * DEPENDENCY - `src/test/setup.ts` matched a three.js warning it merely quotes.
 * That fails safe (a dead file reads as alive, never the reverse) and it is why
 * `src/test/` is excluded outright: it is test infrastructure that never ships.
 *
 * A file with no usable marker is reported as `unknown`, never as dead. That
 * honesty is the whole value of the tool: pass 4's mistake was acting on one
 * signal, and a tool that guesses when it cannot tell would reproduce it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * USAGE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   node scripts/audit-module-reachability.mjs            # gate: exits 1 on drift
 *   node scripts/audit-module-reachability.mjs --list     # every module, with verdict
 *   node scripts/audit-module-reachability.mjs --json     # machine-readable
 *
 * The gate needs a CURRENT `dist/`. It refuses to run against a build older than
 * the newest source file rather than reporting a stale answer confidently.
