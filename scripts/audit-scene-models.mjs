/**
 * Every model in every scene, checked against the defect classes this repo has
 * actually paid for.
 *
 * WHY A RUNTIME SWEEP. Four of these classes are invisible in the source and in
 * the asset. `vertexColors` without a `color` attribute turned 122 meshes black
 * while every gate stayed green, and it was a batcher rewriting the material of
 * a mesh whose geometry it did not rewrite - a defect in the space between two
 * objects. A colour-space mistake is a property of the texture object that is
 * bound, not of the line that created it. A NaN bound is produced by an
 * argument three frames upstream. None of them can be found by reading files,
 * and `validate:assets` cannot see them because they are not in the assets.
 *
 * So this reads the RESOLVED draw state of every mesh through the runtime hook,
 * in every benchmark scene, and applies one rule per known defect class.
 *
 * The scene list is PARSED OUT of `src/runtime/runtimeMode.ts` rather than
 * copied, for the reason `capture-art-review.mjs` already documents: the
 * runtime silently coerces an unknown scene name to `overview`, so a stale copy
 * of the list would audit the same scene several times and report confident
 * full coverage.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/audit-scene-models.mjs [--scenes=a,b] [--quality=medium] [--json=path]

   * transients of two separate page loads. Adding them was an inert term with a
   * confident comment attached, which is worse than not adding them.

   * The village's real answer is that 66% is a MESH-COUNT statistic: 54 of its

   * `static-merge` output whose colours ride vertex colours. Read the two
