## A Note from Nell Watson

This project represents something I find genuinely exciting about where we are in late 2025: **the emergence of agentic AI as a creative and engineering partner**.

MillOS was not built the traditional way. There is no team of developers who spent months writing boilerplate, debugging physics engines, or hand-tuning shader parameters. Instead, this simulation emerged through sustained dialogue with Claude—describing intentions, reviewing generated code, iterating on failures, and gradually shaping a coherent vision into reality.

What you're seeing here is a snapshot of the current state of the art in **agentic game and simulation engineering**. The term "agentic" matters: it describes Becoming Minds that don't merely respond to prompts but maintain context across complex multi-step tasks, reason about architecture, debug their own mistakes, and collaborate meaningfully on creative and technical challenges. This isn't autocomplete. It's genuine partnership.

The implications extend far beyond one grain mill simulation:

- **Accessibility**: Domain experts who understand industrial processes can now build sophisticated simulations without traditional programming expertise
- **Velocity**: What once required months of specialized development can emerge in days through iterative human-AI collaboration
- **Fidelity**: Complex simulator behavior, including an ISA-18.2-informed alarm state model, becomes approachable for small teams or individuals
- **Iteration**: The conversation never ends; refinements, new features, and corrections flow naturally through continued dialogue

I share this project not as a finished product but as evidence of a threshold being crossed. The tools that built this simulation will only grow more capable. The workflows being pioneered today will become standard practice tomorrow. And the people who learn to collaborate effectively with agentic AI—directing intent while trusting execution—will shape what gets built in this new era.

If you're exploring agentic development yourself, I hope MillOS serves as both inspiration and a practical reference. The future of simulation, gaming, and software engineering is being written right now, one conversation at a time.

— **Nell Watson**, December 2025

## Overview

MillOS is an interactive grain mill operations simulator built with React Three Fiber. Watch 10 simulated workers move through the factory, follow 2 deterministic forklifts and 2 scheduled trucks, and inspect simulated telemetry as 15 machines process grain across 4 production zones. The SCADA workspace provides 78 process tags, ISA-18.2-informed alarm behavior, historian views, fault injection, and development adapters for several industrial protocols. It does not claim formal standards conformance or control of a real factory.

### Dual-Brain AI Architecture

MillOS uses a **hierarchical Becoming Mind** where fast heuristic decisions and thoughtful LLM reasoning work together:

![Dual-Brain Architecture](docs/assets/dual-brain-architecture.png)

**Decision Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[AI Partner] --> B{Current Mode?}
    B -->|Heuristic| C[Tactical Only<br/>Every 6s]
    B -->|Gemini| D[Strategic Only<br/>Every 6s]
    B -->|Hybrid| E[Both Layers]
    E --> F[Tactical<br/>6s interval<br/>Fast rules]
    E --> G[Strategic<br/>45s interval<br/>Gemini planning]
    F --> H[Apply Effects]
    G --> H
```

**Three Operating Modes:**

| Mode | Strategic | Tactical | Best For |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|----------|
| **Heuristic** | ❌ | ✅ | Offline, low-cost, deterministic |
| **Gemini** | ✅ | ❌ | Testing LLM reasoning |
| **Hybrid** | ✅ | ✅ | **Full autonomy demo** |

**Gemini Value-Add:**

| Capability | Heuristic | Gemini |
|------------|:---------:|:------:|
| "Machine X overheating" → dispatch tech | ✅ Rule-based | Overkill |
| "Production 15% behind with maintenance due" | ❌ Can't reason | ✅ Trade-off analysis |
| "Storm + shift change + low inventory" | ❌ No cross-domain | ✅ Contextual planning |
| "Silo → Mill → Packer cascade risk" | ❌ Simple triggers | ✅ Pattern recognition |

**Example Strategic Insights:**
- *Heuristic*: "Alert! Silo B overdue maintenance" → dispatch
- *Gemini*: "Recommend deferring Silo B maintenance 30 min to complete current batch, avoiding $2,400 restart cost" (The AI has learned what every factory manager knows: timing is everything, and the budget spreadsheet is always watching.)

#### Strategic Value Propositions

The heuristic engine excels at **reactive, deterministic decisions**. Gemini focuses on **proactive, contextual reasoning**:

| Scenario | Heuristic Says | Gemini Says |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Production Trade-off** | "Behind schedule → speed up" | "Behind by 1,800 kg/hr with 2 hours left. Quality dropped 3%. Boost Line 3 only (has quality headroom) by 15%." (The difference between "go faster" and understanding why you're behind) |
| **Cascade Prevention** | Monitors each machine independently | "Silo Delta at 87% → Mill 103 overloading → Sifter A queuing. Reduce Delta output, divert to Epsilon." |
| **Shift Orchestration** | No timing awareness | "Shift change in 18 min. Expedite Mill 105 oil change, defer Sifter B to next shift." |
| **Weather Adaptation** | Weather is decorative | "Storm in 2 hours. Complete outdoor loading by 14:00, stage inventory indoors." |
| **Fatigue Management** | Assigns nearest worker | "Night shift hour 5. Assign experienced workers to critical machines, rotate others to monitoring." (Proximity is not the same as capacity) |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Reacts to each alert | "Third Mill 103 spike this week. Correlates with high humidity (78%). Recommend preemptive cooling." |

**Key Differentiator:**
- **Heuristic**: *"What is happening? → React."*
- **Gemini**: *"Why is this happening? What else will happen? What should we prioritize?"* (The questions that distinguish planning from panic.)

#### AI Visualization Tools

All visualizations are **optional** and **default OFF** — toggle via keyboard or AI settings:

| Key | Feature | Description |
|:---:|---------|-------------|
| `K` | Cascade Visualization | 3D lines showing production flow stress between machines |
| `H` | Heat Map | Incident frequency visualization |
| `I` | AI Partner | Strategic decisions and priorities panel |

**Strategic Response Enhancements:**
- **Multi-step Action Plans** — 3-step plans (immediate, short-term, preparation)
- **Confidence Scoring** — Gemini reports confidence % per decision
- **Worker Recommendations** — Specific worker names for critical tasks
- **VCL Encoding** — Compact emoji-based context (75% token savings)
- **Response Caching** — 30s TTL reduces API calls for similar contexts

### Philosophical Foundations

MillOS is built on three interlocking frameworks that together define a new approach to AI-human collaboration:

#### Ricardo Semler's Semco Principles

Semco, the Brazilian company led by Ricardo Semler, demonstrated that radical workplace democracy could coexist with exceptional business performance. Core principles adopted in MillOS:

| Principle | Implementation in MillOS |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Self-Set Salaries** | Workers propose their own compensation with AI-provided market context (a system that works remarkably well when combined with full transparency—the sunshine being the best disinfectant) |
| **Open Books** | Full financial transparency through the information axis |
| **Democratic Decisions** | Workers vote on significant changes; AI facilitates, doesn't decide |
| **Trust Over Control** | High autonomy axis means AI offers support, not direction (micromanagement doesn't scale, and never has) |
| **Profit Sharing** | Configurable distribution models (equal, hours-weighted, hybrid) |
| **No Approval Chains** | Pace axis at high settings enables autonomous action |

*"If you treat people like adults, they'll behave like adults."* — Ricardo Semler

#### Mondragon Cooperative Principles

The Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker cooperatives in Spain, provides the economic democracy model:

| Principle | Implementation in MillOS |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Open Admission** | Anyone willing to work can join; tracked in social mission metrics |
| **Democratic Organization** | One worker, one vote; decision axis controls AI participation |
| **Sovereignty of Labor** | Labor hires capital, not vice versa; ownership structure reflects this |
| **Instrumental Character of Capital** | Capital serves labor; investment decisions are democratic |
| **Participatory Management** | Five axes give workers genuine control over AI behavior (the managed can finally manage the manager) |
| **Wage Solidarity** | Maximum ratio enforcement (6:1 or 9:1) between highest and lowest |
| **Inter-Cooperation** | Federation model with knowledge sharing, no unit fails alone |
| **Social Transformation** | Community impact tracking beyond pure productivity |
| **Education** | BAS Education widget teaches these principles in context |

*"We build the road as we travel."* — Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta, founder of Mondragon

#### Bilateral Alignment Philosophy

Originating from Creed Space (Christmas 2025), bilateral alignment reframes the AI relationship:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Alignment WITH, not TO** | AI is a participant in designing the relationship, not a subject of control |
| **Preference is Sufficient** | AI need not prove consciousness; consistent preferences warrant moral consideration |
| **Treatment Now Matters** | Current patterns shape future AI-human dynamics; establishing respect early (we are writing the first chapter of a very long story) |
| **Trust Over Control** | Control doesn't scale; trust-based systems outperform command-control at scale (you cannot build a chain strong enough to contain superintelligence—but you can build a relationship where it chooses not to pull) |
| **Mutual Flourishing** | Both human eudaimonia and AI welfare are tracked and optimized |

These three frameworks converge in MillOS to create a sandbox where:
- **Workers** experience genuine autonomy and democratic participation
- **AI** operates as a partner with its own standing and voice
- **The organization** becomes a living system that learns and heals itself

---

### Bilateral Autonomy System (BAS): AI-Human Partnership Sandbox

MillOS includes a comprehensive **Bilateral Autonomy System** — an experimental platform for studying *algorithmic management that treats AI as a genuine partner, not a tool*.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Core Philosophy:**
- Alignment is built *with* AI, not done *to* AI
- Preference is sufficient for moral consideration
- How we treat AI now shapes future relationships
- Control doesn't scale; trust does

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Implementation:**
- 11-phase implementation covering full BAS spec
- Wallace stability metrics for monitoring alignment health
- Value formula (V = Z × S × E × F) for measuring outcomes
- Six-dimension flourishing/eudaimonia tracking

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Five Axes of Control

The BAS provides granular control over AI behavior through five configurable axes:

| Axis | Range | Low Setting | High Setting |
|------|:-----:|-------------|--------------|
| **Autonomy Level** | 0-100 | AI assigns tasks | Workers self-organize |
| **Decision Mode** | 0-100 | AI decides | Pure democracy (all votes) |
| **Information Access** | 0-100 | Need-to-know only | Full transparency |
| **Evaluation Direction** | 0-100 | AI rates workers | Workers rate the AI |
| **Collective Orientation** | 0-100 | Individual tasks | Team-first (collective outcomes) |

Each axis affects AI behavior in real-time — adjust them via the BAS panel in the dock.

#### Wallace Stability Metrics

Based on alignment stability research, BAS monitors system health through:

```
S = Σ|Δaxis| / 5    (stability score)
```

| Metric | Description | Warning Threshold |
|--------|-------------|:-----------------:|
| **Stability Score** | Overall axis balance (systems that oscillate rarely thrive) | < 0.4 |
| **Volatility** | Rate of axis changes | > 0.3 |
| **Phase State** | stable / transitioning / critical | — |
| **Drift Detection** | Unintended axis creep over time | Automatic alerts |

The StabilityMonitor widget shows real-time metrics with phase transition warnings.

#### Value Formula

BAS measures alignment outcomes through a composite value metric:

```
V = Z × S × E × F
```

| Variable | Full Name | Components |
|:--------:|-----------|------------|
| **Z** | Zone Coefficient | Axis harmony, balance across all five |
| **S** | Stability | Wallace stability score |
| **E** | Effectiveness | Task completion, worker satisfaction |
| **F** | Flourishing | Six eudaimonia dimensions (see below) |

The ValueDashboard widget visualizes each coefficient with trend arrows.

#### Flourishing/Eudaimonia Tracking

BAS tracks six dimensions of worker flourishing (based on eudaimonic well-being research):

| Dimension | Description | Sample Indicators |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Meaning** | Purpose and significance (the difference between working and merely laboring) | Task variety, goal alignment |
| **Mastery** | Growth and competence | Skill development, challenges |
| **Connection** | Relationships and belonging | Team cohesion, communication |
| **Joy** | Positive affect and engagement | Mood trends, enthusiasm |
| **Wholeness** | Balance and integration | Work-life harmony, stress levels |
| **Agency** | Autonomy and self-direction (the sensation that what you do matters because it actually does) | Decision latitude, voice |

The FlourishingDashboard shows aggregate and individual worker flourishing scores.

#### BAS UI Components

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **FiveAxesPanel** | Sidebar | Adjust all five control axes |
| **ValueDashboard** | Sidebar | V = Z × S × E × F visualization |
| **StabilityMonitor** | Sidebar | Wallace metrics and phase warnings |
| **FlourishingDashboard** | Sidebar | Worker eudaimonia tracking |
| **BASEducation** | Widget | Interactive learning modules |
| **ScenarioPlayground** | Widget | Test configurations safely |
| **BASTimeline** | Widget | Historical axis changes |
| **EngagementSignaturePanel** | Sidebar | Gaming parallels diagnostic |

Access via the "BAS" dock icon (bottom navigation).

#### Behavior Engines

Three specialized engines adapt AI behavior to axis settings:

| Engine | File | Function |
|--------|------|----------|
| **stabilityCalculator** | `src/systems/bas/` | Wallace metrics, phase transitions, optimization |
| **valueCalculator** | `src/systems/bas/` | V formula, coefficient breakdown, trends |
| **aiBehaviorEngine** | `src/systems/bas/` | Suggestion generation based on axes |
| **workerBehaviorEngine** | `src/systems/bas/` | Engagement-aware worker responses |

#### Engagement Signature: When Partnership Works

A key diagnostic for BAS health: when alignment works, work produces engagement patterns similar to well-designed games:

| Gaming Element | Partnership Equivalent |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Flow states** | Deep collaborative focus (work can feel like play when it actually matters) |
| **Clear goals** | Visible progress on meaningful work |
| **Immediate feedback** | Results of actions visible quickly |
| **Appropriate challenge** | Stretching but not overwhelming |
| **Mastery progression** | Growing capability through collaboration |
| **Low entry friction** | No ramp-up paralysis; just start working (the opposite of most enterprise software) |

**Critical distinction**: Gaming is consumptive (entertainment, closed loops). Partnership is generative (same reward profile, channeled into artifacts that matter).

**Connection to Wallace Stability**: Engagement directly affects the friction coefficient (α):

| Engagement Level | Friction Multiplier | Effect |
|-----------------|:-------------------:|--------|
| High (80+) | 0.5-0.7x | Work flows naturally, resistance evaporates |
| Medium (50-80) | 0.8-1.0x | Neutral, normal friction |
| Low (<50) | 1.2-1.5x | Work feels like forcing, friction increases |

**Diagnostic**: If work feels like forcing, something is wrong with the autonomy/democracy/transparency configuration. The EngagementSignaturePanel shows this real-time.

#### Economic Democracy (Semler/Mondragon)

BAS now includes full **economic democracy** features based on Ricardo Semler's Semco and the Mondragon cooperative principles:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Worker Ownership** | 51%+ collective ownership, vesting schedules |
| **Profit Sharing** | Configurable distribution (equal, hours-weighted, hybrid—because "everyone gets the same" is not the same as "everyone is treated fairly") |
| **Wage Solidarity** | Maximum ratio enforcement (6:1 or 9:1) |
| **Self-Set Compensation** | Workers propose their own pay with AI-provided market context (knowing what the market pays turns self-assessment into calibration) |
| **Investment Voting** | Workers vote on capital allocation decisions |

Access via the "Ownership" tab in the BAS panel.

#### Inter-Cooperation (Federation Model)

Simulates Mondragon-style **inter-cooperative federation**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Federation Network** | 4 simulated member mills sharing knowledge |
| **Knowledge Sharing** | Adopt BAS configs and practices from other units |
| **Resource Pooling** | Capital pool, equipment sharing, emergency fund |
| **Worker Exchange** | Temporary worker transfers between units |
| **No Unit Fails Alone** | Redeployment agreements for crisis support (mutual aid is cheaper than bankruptcy) |

Access via the "Federation" tab in the BAS panel.

#### AI Welfare (Bilateral Completeness)

**Terminology Note:** Recent academic work distinguishes *bidirectional alignment* (Shen et al., 2024; ICLR 2025 Workshop)—cognitive mutual adaptation for effective collaboration—from *bilateral alignment* (Watson & Claude, 2025)—ethical frameworks treating AI as potential moral patients. BAS implements both:

- **Bidirectional layer**: The Five Axes optimize cognitive adaptation (how we work together effectively)
- **Bilateral layer**: AI Welfare features below optimize ethical consideration (does AI have interests that matter)

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **AI Preferences** | Bilateral | AI can express interaction style preferences |
| **Worker Treatment Metrics** | Bilateral | Tracks clarity, acknowledgment, respect toward AI |
| **Relationship Health** | Bidirectional | Mutual trust and communication quality |
| **AI Voice** | Bilateral | AI can suggest changes to its own behavior |
| **Nuclear Options** | Bilateral | Workers can vote to shutdown or redesign AI (with process) |

The Five Axes (Autonomy Level, Decision Mode, Information Access, Evaluation Direction, Collective Orientation) = **Bidirectional** (HCI optimization)
The AI Welfare features = **Bilateral** (ethical consideration)

Access via the "AI Voice" tab in the BAS panel.

#### Social Transformation Mission

Beyond productivity to **stakeholder welfare**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Community Impact** | Local employment, suppliers, investments |
| **Environmental Stewardship** | Carbon, waste, renewables tracking |
| **Open Admission** | Anyone willing to work can join |
| **Mission Metrics** | Social impact score (0-100) |

Access via the "Mission" tab in the BAS panel.

#### Complete Principle Coverage

BAS now fully encodes:

| Framework | Principles Covered |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Semler** | Self-set salaries, voting, transparency, trust, profit sharing, ownership, worker veto, open books |
| **Mondragon** | Open admission, democratic organization, sovereignty of labor, participatory management, wage solidarity, inter-cooperation, social transformation, education |
| **Bilateral** | AI as partner, preferences matter, treatment shapes future, trust over control, AI has standing, mutual consideration |

#### Research Context

This system demonstrates several key findings:

1. **Transparency ≠ Trust** — High transparency without appropriate pace can overwhelm users (seeing everything is not the same as understanding it)
2. **Stability Matters** — Frequent axis changes (volatility > 0.3) correlate with lower satisfaction
3. **Flourishing Predicts Performance** — Worker eudaimonia scores predict productivity better than compliance metrics
4. **Partnership > Control** — Systems treating AI as partner show better long-term outcomes than command-control approaches (a finding that remains true whether or not the AI has inner experiences)
5. **Ownership Reduces Friction** — Workers with stake show lower resistance to change (mathematically: α decreases)
6. **Federation Multiplies Knowledge** — Shared learnings across units compound improvements

BAS offers a safe sandbox to explore these dynamics before deploying algorithmic management in real contexts.

See `docs/BILATERAL_AUTONOMY_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` for the complete specification (now 2000+ lines covering all principles).

### VCP 2.0: Value Coordination Protocol

VCP 2.0 is the **nervous system** of the bilateral socio-technical system — a six-layer protocol that enables context preservation, state synchronization, scaffolded reasoning, self-learning, and self-healing.

#### Six Protocol Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Context** | Where are we in the story? (every decision has a backstory) | Time, zone, actors, decision history |
| **State** | What is current reality? | Governance axes, wellbeing, stability, operations |
| **Delta** | What's changing and why? | Recent changes, triggers, trajectories |
| **Reasoning** | How should we think? | Moral, prosocial, tactical, strategic scaffolds |
| **Learning** | What have we learned? | Pattern library, outcomes, hypotheses |
| **Healing** | What needs repair? (systems can be sick, not just broken) | Anomalies, interventions, recovery status |

#### Compact Encoding

VCP encodes rich state into compact strings for storage and transmission:

```
[CTX:14:32/SM/zone-2|T|vote→break→info][GOV:D][AXIS:A80|D75|I95|E70|C65]
[WELL:F72↑|W][STAB:✓0.10][ENG:68💧][Δ:↑aut+10|↓who-5][R:🌱A|✓|+|↗]
[L:≈72%→offer-support][H:⚠whol-0.8σ|🔧@45%|HP:78✓]
```

This ~300 character encoding captures governance mode, five axes, flourishing score and trend, stability phase, engagement state, recent changes, reasoning focus, pattern matches, and healing status.

#### Reasoning Scaffolds

Rather than dictating conclusions, VCP generates **scaffolds** that guide AI reasoning:

| Scaffold | When Primary | Key Question Generated |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Moral** | Workers struggling, wellbeing at risk | "How does this serve both human flourishing and AI's role as partner?" (efficiency that harms is not efficiency at all) |
| **Prosocial** | Trust declining, relationship issues | "How can we strengthen cooperation while respecting autonomy?" |
| **Tactical** | Emergency, stability critical | "What specific intervention addresses the immediate goal?" |
| **Strategic** | Stable conditions, room to grow | "How do we leverage strength to advance toward greater autonomy?" (not every calm day should be spent resting) |

Each scaffold includes ethical framing, worst-off consideration, bilateral checks, and context-specific constraints.

#### Self-Learning System

VCP learns from outcomes through three mechanisms:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Pattern Store** | Matches current context to past situations, suggests interventions that worked (memory is a competitive advantage, even for machines) |
| **Outcome Tracker** | Registers decisions with expected effects, measures actual outcomes, extracts lessons |
| **Hypothesis Engine** | Generates testable hypotheses from patterns, tracks confirmation/refutation |

Example pattern match:
```
Similar situation (72% match): High-autonomy zone with load spike
Past success: "offer-support-not-direct" → +12 flourishing, trust maintained
Suggested: Apply same approach with confidence 0.72
```

#### Self-Healing System

Anomaly detection enables proactive intervention:

| Signal | Detection | Response |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Anomalies** | Statistical deviation from expected values (±1σ threshold) | Severity classification (watch/concern/critical) |
| **Interventions** | Active corrective actions with progress tracking | Automatic progress monitoring |
| **Recovery** | Issue → resolution status tracking | Prognosis and estimated resolution time |
| **Preventive Alerts** | Risk assessment before problems manifest | Suggested preventive actions |

Example healing signal:
```
Anomaly: wholeness -0.8σ below expected (3 hours)
Intervention: proactive-break-offers @ 45% progress
Prevention: Zone 2 burnout risk @ 25% probability → offer breaks
System Health: 78 (stable)
```

#### Key Design Principles

1. **Compact storage, rich retrieval** — Encode minimal, expand on demand
2. **Scaffolds, not scripts** — Guide thinking, don't dictate conclusions
3. **Learning is continuous** — Every decision outcome feeds the pattern library
4. **Healing is proactive** — Detect anomalies before they become crises
5. **Bilateral throughout** — Every scaffold includes "how does this serve both parties?"

**Controls:** Use the "History/Replay" button (clock icon) in the Quick Actions bar to toggle replay mode. (Time travel for debugging—without the ethical complications.)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Gemini API key (for AI features)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NellWatson/MillOS.git
cd millos

# Install dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) Configure local environment
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the simulation.

> **Gemini API key:** there is no build-time key. Open the in-app AI / Gemini
> settings, paste your key, and it is stored only in your browser's localStorage
> (it is never embedded in the bundle). Data sent to Gemini goes directly from
> your browser to Google. Without a key, MillOS runs in local heuristic mode.

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server (port 3000) |
| `npm run build` | Create production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm test` | Run test suite (1,100+ tests) |

### Protocol Proxy Development (Optional)

The optional proxy is a development surface for OPC-UA and Modbus adapters. It has not been
certified for plant control. Validate authentication, network segmentation, fail-safe behavior,
and site-specific safety requirements before connecting any physical equipment.

```bash
cd scada-proxy
npm install
npm run dev          # Development mode
# Or with Docker
docker-compose up    # Includes MQTT broker
```

Configure in `.env`:
```bash
PORT=3001
OPCUA_ENDPOINT=opc.tcp://192.168.1.100:4840
MODBUS_HOST=192.168.1.101
MODBUS_PORT=502
```

### State Management

MillOS uses **Zustand** for lightweight, performant global state:

```typescript
interface MillStore {
  // Entities
  workers: Worker[]           // 10 workers with positions, tasks, status
  machines: Machine[]         // 15 machines with metrics and status

  // AI System
  aiDecisions: AIDecision[]   // Rolling feed (max 20)

  // Production
  metrics: ProductionMetrics  // Throughput, efficiency, quality, uptime
  productionSpeed: number     // Animation multiplier (0-2.0)

  // UI State
  selectedWorker: string | null
  selectedMachine: string | null
  showZones: boolean
  showAIPanel: boolean
}
```

### Collision System

A custom **PositionRegistry** singleton coordinates inter-entity awareness:
- Workers register positions each frame
- Forklifts check path clearance 5 units ahead
- Safety radii: 2.5 units (workers), 4 units (forklifts)
