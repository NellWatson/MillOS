/**
 * Surface finish for the LIVE conveyor renderer (`src/components/ConveyorSystem.tsx`).
 *
 * `src/components/conveyors/CompactConveyorSystem.tsx` is unreachable dead code -
 * nothing imports it - so anything authored there renders nothing. Confirmed by
 * `npm run validate:reachability`, which lists it with a reason. This module is
 * the single owner of the conveyor branch's analytic surface treatment.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS BRANCH NEEDED ITS OWN MODULE
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * `world-conveyors` was the only branch in the scene at **0% shader** after
 * pass 4 finished every other one - 163 meshes of belts, rollers, frames and
 * guard rails threading through `interior`, `milling`, `packing` and `silos`.
 * It was not a texturing job: three quarters of those meshes already carry a
 * normal and a roughness map from `utils/sharedMaterials.ts`. What they lacked
 * was the metre-scale variation that stops a 55 m belt run and its 25 identical
 * rollers reading as one extruded colour.
 *
 * THE MATERIALS ARE CLONED RATHER THAN TREATED IN PLACE. `METAL_MATERIALS`,
 * `SAFETY_MATERIALS` and `MACHINE_MATERIALS` in `utils/sharedMaterials.ts` are
 * module-level singletons, and the only LIVE consumer of those three is the
 * conveyor system (every other importer of that file takes `WALL_MATERIALS`,
 * `OUTDOOR_MATERIALS`, `PROCEDURAL_TEXTURES` or `SHARED_GEOMETRIES`; the
 * machines have their own set in `machines/machineSurfaces.ts`). Treating the
 * singletons in place would therefore work today and become an invisible trap
 * the moment something else imports one - a component picking up conveyor grime
 * because of an import it never made. Clones cost eleven material objects and
 * no draw calls: `clone()` copies map REFERENCES, and every profile shares one
 * `customProgramCacheKey`, so the program count is unchanged.
 *
 * Cloning FIRST and injecting SECOND is the safe order. The reverse - cloning a
 * material that already carries the treatment - produces the JSON ghost
 * `worldSurface` guards against: `THREE.Material.copy()` runs userData through
 * `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` and does not copy `onBeforeCompile`.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * COORDINATE SPACE: THE ROLLERS SPIN, SO THEY CANNOT USE THE WORLD FIELD
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * `RollerConveyor` recomposes all 25 instance matrices every frame with a fresh
 * `_tempEuler.set(Math.PI / 2, rotation, 0)`. A world-space detail field is
 * nailed to the world, so a rotating surface sliding through it makes the
 * detail SWIM across the roller - the same failure the worker bodies have, for
 * the same reason. The roller profile therefore overrides `objectSpace` to 1,
 * which welds the field to the geometry.
 *
 * The trade is that all 25 instances then sample IDENTICALLY, because object
 * space is taken from the shared `position` attribute rather than from
 * `transformed`. For rollers cut from one drum that is correct - they are
 * identical parts. Do NOT copy the override onto the frames or the rails: those
 * are static, and the world field is exactly what stops two identical 30 m
 * frame boxes reading as two copies of one prefab.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * HOW A CHANGE HERE IS VERIFIED
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * NOT by `audit-scene-models.mjs`. That instrument scores a mesh as finished on
 * the MERE PRESENCE of a shader injection, so this file could be inert and the
 * branch would still leave the work list. The paired control is
 *
 *   npm run measure:surfaces -- --label=<name> --scenes=interior,milling,packing,silos
 *
 * and an exactly-zero changed fraction means the term is not there.
