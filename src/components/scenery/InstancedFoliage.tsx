/**
 * InstancedFoliage - alpha-cut card vegetation for the village, the farm and
 * the exterior parkland.
 *
 * Replaces solid-polyhedron canopies (three spheres of flat `#3b7638`) with a
 * cage of alpha-tested leaf cards. From any viewing angle four to six cards
 * are visible, so the canopy has a ragged silhouette and real inter-card
 * parallax while costing FEWER triangles than the spheres it replaces, and
 * one draw call for every tree of a species instead of one per blob.
 *
 * KEY DECISIONS
 *
 * - `alphaTest`, never blending. Alpha-tested materials write depth and sort
 *   as opaque, so there is no transparency-ordering flicker (the failure mode
 *   CLAUDE.md warns about) and no per-frame sort.
 * - Cards are emitted with BOTH windings and the material stays `FrontSide`.
 *   The obvious alternative, `DoubleSide`, makes three negate the normal on
 *   back faces (`normal *= faceDirection`), which would invert the outward-bent
 *   canopy normals and light the far side of every tree from inside. Two
 *   windings cost nothing: exactly one of each pair survives back-face culling
 *   from any given view, so nothing is rasterised twice and nothing z-fights.
 * - Canopy vertex normals are blended toward the canopy centre-to-vertex
 *   direction. Flat card normals make a canopy read as a stack of plates; a
 *   spherical bend makes it read as a volume. This is free.
 * - Per-instance colour from the shared `treeJitterFromPosition` hash, so a
 *   given tree looks identical whether the village, the farm or the exterior
 *   draws it, and "every tree is the same green" is fixed for one float3.
 * - `alphaToCoverage` is deliberately OFF: `COMPOSER_MULTISAMPLING === 0`
 *   (src/constants/colorGrade.ts) and the composer owns the render target from
 *   the medium tier up, so there is no MSAA for coverage to modulate. Turning
 *   it on would imply an anti-aliased cut edge that does not exist. SMAA
 *   handles the silhouette instead.

 * A trunk from a designed (radius, y) profile, base sitting on y = 0.
 *
 * These were `CylinderGeometry(topRadius, bottomRadius, height, 12)` - a
 * straight cone, which is a table leg, not a trunk. What makes a trunk read as
 * grown rather than driven into the ground is the ROOT FLARE: a short concave
 * swell at the foot, a knee where it meets the bole, and then a bole that
 * tapers on a slight inward curve rather than a straight line. All three are
 * in the profiles below, and all three carry at the 8-10 m the camera actually
 * walks past a village or farm tree at.
 *
 * Twelve sides is kept exactly as it was and is NOT the redesign here: the
 * chord argument for 12 (0.207 m at the oak's 0.64 m base, against 0.400 m at
 * 6) is unchanged, and the flare is a profile change, not a facet change.
 *
 * ENVELOPE. Every profile below opens at (bottomRadius, -height/2) and closes
 * at (topRadius, +height/2), and only ever dips INSIDE the straight line
 * between them, so max radius and the y range are bit-identical to the
 * cylinder each replaces (verified 0.00 mm by
 * scripts/blender/machine_part_preview.py --spec specs/trees-canopy.json).
 *
 * COST. One shared module-level geometry per species drawn through an
 * InstancedMesh, so the extra vertices are a one-off scene cost at any tree
 * count: oak 76 -> 156, birch 76 -> 143, pine 76 -> 195 - +333 vertices for
 * every tree on the site.
