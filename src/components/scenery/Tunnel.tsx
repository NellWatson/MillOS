 * what say "pipe laid in a trench" instead of "extruded plastic".
 *
 * The joint collars and the mouth lands sit AT radius 1.0 and the barrel is set

 * growth: max radius 1.0 and y in [-0.5, 0.5] are exactly the cylinder's. In

 * `drainage_barrel`) at 21 mm, 33 mm and 48 mm: 21 mm washed out at distance and
 * 48 mm cost 8% of the crown height for no extra legibility.
 *
 * Segments go UP, 16 to 32, and that is a second change riding alongside the
 * profile rather than part of it, so it gets its own argument. At 16 the
 * exposed 120-degree arc is 5.3 facets wide and the crown silhouette sits
 * 11.5 mm inside its own circle - a visible polygon on a 1.2 m pipe you can
 * walk up to. 32 halves the facet and takes that to 2.9 mm. The profile is

 * Brick tunnel arch: a hollow half-barrel with a voussoir ring at each mouth.
 *
 * The geometry this replaces never read as a tunnel at all, and it is worth
 * saying so plainly rather than claiming an improvement on a working thing.
 * `CylinderGeometry(width/2, width/2, length, 16, 1, true, 0, PI)` was rotated
 * [0, 0, PI/2], which lays the barrel axis along X - across the side walls and
 * the mouth keystones, which both run along Z. It was also openEnded with a
 * FrontSide material, so the soffit was backface-culled and the camera looked
 * straight through the vault.
 *
 * This is a `LatheGeometry` with `phiLength = PI` about the tunnel axis, and a
 * CLOSED profile, which buys the three things an arch is made of:
 *
 *  - a 0.13 m ring wall between an intrados at 0.83333 and an extrados at 0.92,
 *    so the soffit is a real front-facing surface you can stand under;
 *  - an archivolt at each mouth stepping out to 1.0 for the last 0.35 m, with
 *    a 0.12 m reveal so the ring OVERHANGS the recessed soffit annulus. A
 *    single flat mouth annulus was built first and rejected on the render: it
 *    reads as a washer, and the shadow line the reveal throws is the whole
 *    difference (`brick_arch_single_order` in the spec);
 *  - a springing at exactly the half width, which is why the intrados lands on
 *    0.83333: at the shipped width of 3 m the bore is 2.5 m, flush with the
 *    side walls' inner faces, and the archivolt's 1.0 is flush with their outer
 *    faces, so the lathe's open phi ends are covered by the walls.
 *
 * Segments go DOWN, 16 to 13. Thirteen is odd, so a facet is centred on the
 * apex and the crown is a stone rather than a joint, and the flat shading below
 * turns those facets into voussoirs. A 26-facet version was rendered alongside
 * and is indistinguishable at the distance a 3 m tunnel is seen from.
 *
 * `toNonIndexed().computeVertexNormals()` is the point of the low count, not an
 * afterthought: LatheGeometry's normals are smooth AROUND the sweep, so 13
 * segments would otherwise shade as a slightly polygonal smooth tube. Splitting
 * the faces is what makes them read as masonry.
 *
 * Envelope: max radius 1.0 at the springing and y in [-0.5, 0.5] are exact. The
 * apex of a 13-sided arch inscribes its circle and sits 0.73% low - 11 mm at
 * the shipped 3 m width. Nothing is positioned against the crown (the walls
 * meet the springing, the keystone is authored with it below), and the
 * component has no call sites anywhere in the app to retune - `BrickTunnel` and
 * `MetalCulvert` are exported but unused; only `DrainageCulvert` is placed, and
 * that one holds its envelope to 0.00 mm.

 * inner face on the intrados, outer face on the archivolt - so the ring, the
 * wall and the springing are one plane rather than three near-misses, and the
 * lathe's open phi ends sit on the wall tops where nothing can see them.
 *
 * The keystones used to float 0.75 m below the crown at the side of the barrel.
 * They now sit ON the soffit crown, project 0.12 m above the ring and 0.105 m
 * out of the mouth face, which is what a keystone does.
