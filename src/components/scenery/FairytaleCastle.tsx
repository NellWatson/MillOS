/**
 * Tower silhouettes, drawn as lathe profiles.
 *
 * The castle stands at [45, 0, -200] at a site scale of 1.5 - a skyline
 * landmark read from 150-250 m away, never approached. That distance decides
 * everything below: a 0.2 m moulding is a fifth of a pixel and is not worth a
 * vertex, while the presence or absence of a corbel course, a crenellated
 * parapet or a flared eave is what separates "castle" from "pipe with a cone
 * on it". These profiles were designed and previewed against the app's own
 * camera (fov 65, 1080 px tall, 200 m out) in scripts/blender/specs/castle.json
 * plus an assembled in-situ render; features that did not survive that frame
 * were cut rather than shipped.
 *
 * Every profile keeps the EXACT unit envelope of the primitive it replaces -
 * max radius and y range - so no mesh position in this file moves. What does
 * move, deliberately, is where inside that envelope the widest ring sits: both
 * cone caps previously reached full radius at their bottom edge and so sleeved
 * down over the tower they were meant to sit on. Raising the widest ring to an
 * eave is the whole point of the redesign, and the harness still reports 0.00
 * mm drift because the half-extents are untouched.
 *
 * The castle is a single non-instanced landmark, so these geometries are built
 * once at module scope and shared - the two gatehouse turrets now draw one
 * body geometry and one cap geometry between them instead of a fresh pair
 * each. Nothing here carries a pointer handler, so no picking proxy is needed.
 *
 * Cost, counted on both sides of the batcher: as authored geometry the redesign
 * is +958 vertices, but MillScene wraps the castle in a StaticMeshBatch, which
 * merges compatible opaque meshes into one buffer and so copies a shared
 * geometry once per mesh that used it. Counted across the batched scene it is
 * about +1,485. Sharing still buys the geometry build, the second upload and
 * the bookkeeping - just not merged-buffer bytes. Either number is rounding
 * error for a landmark.
 *
 * The batcher keys its merge groups on flatShading among much else (see
 * materialSignature in StaticMeshBatch), which is load-bearing here: the
 * crenellation ring is the only cast+receive+flatShading mesh in the castle, so
 * it cannot be folded in with the smooth-shaded walls and keeps a buffer of its
 * own. Give another mesh that exact signature and the merlons join it.

/**
 * Crenellated parapet - 12 merlons, each 1.27 m wide, 1.27 m deep, 1.5 m tall.
 *
 * New geometry: the tower had no crenellation at all. This is the one feature
 * here that must not be round, and it is worth stating why it is not a
 * "ribbed" lathe. Ribbing modulates RADIUS with angle - it cuts vertical flutes
 * into a wall and leaves the top edge of the ring perfectly level. Crenellation
 * is a HEIGHT modulation: merlon, gap, merlon, and the whole read is the
 * serrated line against the sky. No surface of revolution, ribbed or not, can
 * express it. So each merlon is a four-sided lathe - a genuine prism, chosen
 * rather than inherited - with a slight batter and a weathered coped top, and
 * the twelve are baked into ONE merged geometry so the ring is a single mesh
 * and a single draw call regardless of what StaticMeshBatch decides.
 *
 * Sized from the render, not from taste: at 200 m through the app's camera a
 * merlon is ~6 px wide and a gap ~4 px, which is the coarsest spacing that
 * still reads as notches rather than as a texture. Ring radius 2.776 puts each
 * merlon's outer FACE (0.424 proud of its centre, since a 4-sided lathe carries
 * its 0.6 half-extent on the corners) exactly on the parapet face at 3.2, and
 * the +45 deg twist is what turns a corner outward into a face outward.
 *
 * The sharpness lives on the MATERIAL, not here: the merged ring carries the
 * smooth per-vertex normals LatheGeometry computes around its revolution, which
 * on a 4-sided prism round the arrises off and read as lozenges. `flatShading`
 * on the mesh below overrides them at shade time. Drop that flag and the
 * crenellation goes soft - the geometry will not save you.
