/**
 * Machine surface materials for the LIVE machine renderer
 * (`src/components/machines/CompactMachines.tsx`).
 *
 * `src/components/Machines.tsx` and the `Instanced*.tsx` tree are unreachable
 * dead code - nothing imports them. Anything authored there renders nothing.
 * This module is the single owner of every material the mill's machines use.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS - three failures the previous material set had
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. THE ROUGHNESS MAP WAS A MATHEMATICAL NO-OP.
 *    Twelve materials carried `roughnessMap: PROCEDURAL_TEXTURES.brushedMetal`.
 *    `generateBrushedMetal` packs R = roughness, G = metalness, B = AO, but
 *    three samples `roughnessMap.g` (`roughnessmap_fragment.glsl.js:9`). Every
 *    one of those materials was multiplying its roughness by the METALNESS
 *    channel - a flat 0.90-1.00 - so the map contributed nothing but a texture
 *    fetch. `generateMachineORM` packs the glTF order (R = AO, G = roughness,
 *    B = metalness) and its G channel spans 0.35-0.85 with mean ~0.582, so it
 *    is a real multiplier. Base `roughness` is therefore authored at or near 1
 *    here and the MAP is the authority, matching the shell in
 *    `OptimizedFactoryInfrastructure.tsx`.
 *
 * 2. THE NORMAL MAP WAS SUB-PIXEL. `generatePanelNormal(256, 8, 0.02)` makes a
 *    bevel 0.02 x (1/8) = 0.0025 UV wide - 0.64 px at 256 - which the mip chain
 *    erases outright, and it was then applied at normalScale 0.06-0.08.
 *    `generateMachinePanelNormal` specifies the bevel in PIXELS and clamps it
 *    to >= 4 px, so it survives mipping. Applied here at 0.5-0.75.
 *
 * 3. PAINTED EQUIPMENT WAS AUTHORED AS HALF-METAL (0.16-0.48). Painted and
 *    powder-coated steel are DIELECTRICS. The 0.05-0.5 band has neither a full
 *    diffuse albedo nor a real specular; it is what makes colours read chalky.
 *    Metalness here is a hard binary: 0 or 1, nothing between.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHICH SURFACES ARE CONDUCTORS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * metalness 1.0 means diffuse is ZERO and the albedo hex becomes F0, the
 * specular reflectance. Real metals have F0 around 0.4-0.95 linear and are
 * NEUTRAL or warm - there is no such thing as a dark blue conductor. Measured
 * linear values of the existing palette:
 *
 *   silo      #c2c9c7 -> 0.539, 0.584, 0.571   galvanised steel      OK
 *   roller    #d0d7d7 -> 0.631, 0.680, 0.680   polished chill roll   OK
 *   hardware  #a8b2b4 -> 0.392, 0.445, 0.456   zinc-plated fittings  OK
 *   siloRoof  #718087 -> 0.165, 0.216, 0.242   far too dark to be a metal
 *   millTrim  #40565b -> 0.056, 0.101, 0.116   far too dark to be a metal
 *
 * So the conductor set is exactly { silo skin, chill rolls, hardware }. Every
 * coloured hex is a painted dielectric. Promoting the dark blue-greys to
 * metalness 1 - as a naive "bare metal is 1.0" pass would - turns them into
 * near-black mirrors.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ALBEDO RE-BALANCE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Dropping metalness m -> 0 multiplies the diffuse term by 1/(1-m), which is up
 * to 1.9x on `millPanel`. To hold the tonal design while still letting the
 * colours come up, each painted hex is scaled in LINEAR space by (1 - m)^0.75:
 * full compensation would cancel the whole point of the fix, none of it would
 * blow the palette out. The exponent leaves painted surfaces roughly 10-15%
 * brighter than before, which is wanted - the lighting rebalance (ambient 0.76
 * -> 0.22, hemisphere 0.7 -> 0.22) took about half the fill off interior faces.
 *
 * NOTE ON TINTS: not one material here has an albedo `map:`, so every `color:`
 * IS the albedo and none of them is a compensating tint for the DataTexture
 * colour-space bug. Nothing was reverted to #ffffff; the only hex changes are
 * the deliberate dielectric rebalance above. The ORM and normal maps are
 * linear/NoColorSpace data and do not multiply hue.
