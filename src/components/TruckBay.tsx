/**
 * DESIGNED LATHE PROFILES FOR THE YARD'S ROUND HARDWARE.
 *
 * Almost everything in this file is a box, so the handful of round parts carry
 * the whole "this is real equipment" read - and all three of them were the same
 * omission: a `CylinderGeometry` whose only shape information was two radii. A
 * truncated cone is what a part looks like when nobody drew it. It is not what a
 * roof vent, a weather cap or a pipe bollard looks like, and on the vent cap it
 * was actively wrong: `CylinderGeometry(0.55, 0.38, ...)` flares OUTWARD going
 * up, so the thing meant to shed rain off the stack was modelled as a bowl that
 * would collect it.
 *
 * Each profile below was drawn, previewed and revised in Blender
 * (`scripts/blender/machine_part_preview.py --spec
 * scripts/blender/specs/dock-vents-tanks.json`) at both a design distance and
 * the distance the camera actually gets, and the numbers here are transcribed
 * from the approved run rather than retyped from intent. Every one keeps the
 * EXACT unit envelope of the cylinder it replaces - nominal max radius and y
 * range, bit-identical - because these parts sit against neighbours placed by
 * hand-tuned offsets.
 *
 * ONE CAVEAT ON "ENVELOPE", stated because the harness prints it. Both vent
 * profiles run 16 radial segments where the cylinders they replace ran 10, so
 * the harness reports 26.92 mm (cap) / 20.56 mm (stack) of half-extent growth
 * on one lateral axis. That is the 16-gon putting a vertex where the 10-gon
 * left a flat: the faceted hull growing out toward the nominal circle, not the
 * part growing. Nothing sits beside the vent on that roof, so it changes no
 * clearance. The bollard kept 12 segments and drifts 0.00 mm on every axis.
 *
 * COST. All three were inline `<cylinderGeometry>` elements, so every mesh
 * allocated its own buffer - four separate geometries for the four bollards
 * alone. Hoisting them to module scope makes each a single shared
 * `BufferGeometry`, which is the win these three actually get.
 *
 * It is NOT a one-off GPU cost, and the difference matters for the bollards.
 * `MillScene` wraps this whole file in `<StaticMeshBatch name="authored-truck-
 * yard">`, whose merge pass runs before its instance pass and whose threshold
 * is `MINIMUM_MERGE_MESHES = 4`. Four bollards, one geometry, one material,
 * one 80 m cell - they hit that threshold exactly, so they go down the MERGE
 * path, and `createMergedGeometry` calls `toNonIndexed()`: 1224 vertices baked
 * per bollard, 4896 for the pad, against 576 for the four cylinders. Four
 * kilo-verts is nothing next to the yard's trucks and docks, and the pad is a
 * walk-past object that earns its silhouette - but the profile is paid four
 * times, not once, and anyone adding a fifth bollard or a denser profile here
 * should know that before doing it.
 *
 * None of these meshes carries a pointer handler - there are none anywhere in
 * this file - so none needs the picking proxy that `SILO_SHELL` needs in
 * CompactMachines.tsx.
 */

/**
 * Roof vent stack on the maintenance garage.
 *
 * Rendered 1.2 m tall and 0.84 m across, standing on the garage ridge at
 * y = 6.45 where its only backdrop is sky. The `CylinderGeometry(0.34, 0.42,
 * 1.2, 10)` it replaces had the silhouette of a lampshade: a smooth taper that
 * said nothing about how the stack meets the roof or what happens at the top.
 *
 * Four features replace that taper, and all four still read at 12 m in the
 * preview: a crisp roof-flashing flange at the base (also the widest point, so
 * it carries the envelope), a downward-flaring storm collar 130 mm above it, a
 * slip-coupling band in the upper third that gives the pipe a legible scale,
 * and a rolled throat rim at the top. The barrel between them is dead straight,
 * because pipe is straight and that straightness is what reads as rolled sheet
 * rather than turned pottery.
 *
 * The throat rim tops out at radius 0.354, deliberately 18 mm inside the 0.372
 * collar on the underside of `ROOF_VENT_CAP`, so the seated cap and the stack
 * never present near-coincident cylindrical faces to the depth buffer.
 *
 * Envelope preserved exactly: max radius 0.42, y in [-0.6, 0.6].

/**
 * Weather cap for the garage roof vent.
 *
 * 1.1 m across and only 0.16 m deep, so there is no room for a bell. What fits
 * a 1:7 aspect ratio is the pressed weather cap: a shallow convex crown that
 * turns down hard at the rim into a vertical drip band.
 *
 * THE CROWN IS CONVEX ON PURPOSE, AND THIS IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Slope grows
 * monotonically from the apex outwards - 0.013, 0.042, 0.090, 0.169, 0.300,
 * 0.524, 1.0, then the 4.4 roll into the 46 mm vertical band. A revision that
 * paired a near-flat brim with a STEEPER conical crown was previewed and
 * rejected: that ordering is dome curvature inverted, and while it read well
 * head-on, the elevated assembly preview showed it as a shallow BOWL - the
 * exact wrong read the original `CylinderGeometry(0.55, 0.38, ...)` already
 * had. The camera here looks down at the crown far more often than it sees the
 * silhouette, so top-down convexity outranks profile crispness. Two earlier
 * revisions failed differently: a plain domed lens read as a contact lens, and
 * a centre boss added to it read as a nipple.
 *
 * The underside is not decorative. It carries a throat collar (radius 0.372 to
 * 0.408) that hangs 10 mm below the stack's top rim, so the cap seats on the
 * pipe instead of floating above it - confirmed in an assembly preview taken
 * from BELOW the brim line, the only view from which a gap could show. The
 * collar's arch between throat and rim keeps the lowest point of the geometry
 * at the rim, where a drip edge belongs.
 *
 * Envelope preserved exactly: max radius 0.55, y in [-0.08, 0.08]. The rim
 * reaches BOTH limits at the same vertex, which is the drip edge.

 * off. A real pipe bollard is the opposite shape: a constant-diameter pipe with
 * a grout skirt where it enters the slab and a pressed dome welded on top.
 *
 * The dome is what does the work. A true hemisphere read as a bullet in the

 * wrap and gives the shaft a scale reference.

      ROOF VENT. The stack and its weather cap are the only drawn silhouettes on
      this roof, seven metres up with nothing behind them but sky, and both were
      bare truncated cones. They are now designed lathe profiles - see
      ROOF_VENT_STACK and ROOF_VENT_CAP at the top of this file for what each
      feature is and why it survives to viewing distance.

      The two positions here are load-bearing and unchanged. The group at
      y = 7.05 puts the stack's flashing flange at y = 6.45, sitting 24 mm above
      the tilted roof slab, whose upper surface is at y = 6.426 directly under
      x = 2.8 - sub-pixel at this height, and a pre-existing offset this change
      deliberately does not disturb. The cap's local y = 0.67 puts its
      throat collar bottom at 0.59, ten millimetres below the stack's 0.60 top
      rim, which is what makes the cap read as seated rather than floating. Both
      geometries keep the exact nominal envelope of the cylinders they replace,
      so those two numbers still mean what they meant.

      Radial segments go 10 -> 16 on both parts, matched to each other so the
      stack and cap facet seams line up instead of beating against each other.
      That is the one dimension in which these two grew: the DESIGNED LATHE
      PROFILES header at the top of this file states what the 16-gon does to
      the measured half-extents and why nothing on this roof cares.
