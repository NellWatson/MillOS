// ===== SKYLINE ROOFS =====
// The church spire, the town hall cupola and the school bell cap are the three
// things in the village that break the treeline, so they are the three that get
// a designed profile rather than a primitive. Each is authored at world scale
// (radius and y are already metres) and each holds the exact envelope of the
// cone it replaces, because every one of them is positioned against a
// hand-tuned neighbour: the spire base is flush with the 4 m tower, the cupola
// eave overhangs the clock tower by 1.6 m, the bell cap overhangs the belfry
// beam by 0.4 m. Max radius and the y range are load-bearing numbers.
//
// All three buildings are singletons, so these vertices are a one-off scene
// cost (1078 across the three - 207 + 700 + 171, the counts three.js reports
// for these LatheGeometries) rather than a per-instance one, and none of the
// three meshes - nor any group above them, up to `authored-village-site` -
// carries a pointer handler, so none needs the picking proxy the corrugated
// silo shell does.

/**
 * Church spire - 4 m across, 6 m tall, carried to 19 m on the tower.
 *
 * A broach spire, not a cone. Bottom to top: a near-vertical 180 mm stone
 * capping course at the rim (a hard shadow line where the slate meets the
 * masonry), a sharp 250 mm break into the splayed skirt, then the long taper
 * carrying about 3.5% entasis - a convex swell peaking around a third of the
 * way up, which is what stops a tall spire reading as sagging inward. It closes
 * with a necking, an astragal ring, a ball finial and a spike that runs up
 * inside the gold cross above it.
 *
 * Eight sides is the design, not a budget: a broach spire IS octagonal, and at
 * this size the hips read as slate arrises running base to finial rather than
 * as facets on a circle. Verified in Blender at 19 m and at 9 m.
 *

 * 2.4 m across and 0.8 m tall, standing on the village cobbles at y=0.12 - so
 * the bottom 120 mm is buried and the widest ring is placed just clear of the
 * paving rather than at the very foot, where nobody would ever see it. The
 * previous `CylinderGeometry(1, 1.2, 0.8, 12)` was a plain tapered drum: the
 * 12-gon read as coursing, but there were no courses in it to read.
 *
 * Deliberately still a 12-gon (`LatheGeometry` at 12 segments is the same
 * inscribed polygon the cylinder was), because at 2.4 m across the 41 mm inset
 * between vertices reads as dressed masonry and sanding it smooth would lose
 * that. What is new is the profile: four battered courses, each stepping in at
 * a joint, under a capstone that projects 190 mm and throws a shadow onto them.
 * The projection is the feature that carries - a well is recognisable by its
 * coping long before its stonework is.
 *
 * The flat top is held at exactly y=+0.40 out to radius 1.07. The Cat prop is
 * seated at world y=0.80 on this face and the dark mouth disc sits at 0.81 with
 * radius 0.75, so any weathering that pulled the top ring below +0.40 would
 * unseat the cat and lift the disc off the stone. Envelope: max radius 1.20,
 * y in [-0.40, 0.40] - identical to the cylinder.

 * Thatched roof for the wishing well.
 *
 * 2.4 m across at 2.8 m - just above head height on a walk-up prop with a
 * pettable cat on its rim, so it is read from two or three metres and mostly
 * from below. `ConeGeometry(1.2, 1, 16)` gave it a straight-sided pitch and a
 * knife-edged rim, which is the one thing thatch never has.
 *
 * Three features, all of them silhouette rather than surface: a fat rolled eave
 * (a 190 mm quarter-round where the straw is cut and combed), a bell-cast
 * slope whose pitch steepens monotonically from ~30 deg at the skirt to ~72 deg
 * at the peak, and the tied bundle at the apex with its binding ring. The
 * bell-cast is what stops it reading as a lampshade: real thatch is flared at
 * the eave because the straw is laid over a tilting fillet.
 *
 * The underside cap is kept. The timber posts run up inside it and the eave is
 * at 2.30, so opening the underside would show their tops floating in a hollow.
 *
 * The bell-cast is also why the posts are 2.0 m and not the 2.2 m they were
 * under the cone. A straight cone is at radius 0.84 at world 2.60; this
 * profile is at 0.689 there, and the posts' corners stand 0.7786 from the
 * axis, so a post that used to be swallowed now pokes a timber block out
 * through the straw. Any future change to this slope has to re-check that
 * clearance against the 20-gon INSCRIBED radius (r * cos(pi/20)), not r.
 *
 * Envelope: max radius 1.20 at the eave, y in [-0.50, 0.50] - identical to the
 * cone. 20 segments leaves a 15 mm crease at the eave radius.

// ===== DUCK POND =====

/**
 * Kerbed bank around the duck pond.
 *
 * 14 m across, walked around and leaned on. It was `RingGeometry(5.5, 7, 32)`
 * laid flat: a zero-thickness annulus painted on the cobbles, needing a
 * polygonOffset to stay out of a depth fight with them, and leaving the water
 * disc's 80 mm cut edge standing exposed above it as a bright blue band with a
 * visibly polygonal outline.
 *
 * This is the one object in this file whose envelope deliberately changes:
 * there is no zero-drift version of "flat annulus becomes a shaped bank". It
 * gains 150 mm of y half-extent. Nothing in the scene is positioned against
 * the ring's extent - DuckPond is a singleton at [20, 0, 25], the ducks float
 * at y=0.35 inside radius 2.5, and the lily pads at y=0.33 inside radius 2.6 -
 * so the only relationships that matter are the two this profile is designed
 * around, and both are held:
 *
 *   - The inner lip is at radius 5.44, at y=+0.07 (world 0.220), overhanging
 *     the r=5.5 water top at world 0.19. At 48 segments the lip's own facet
 *     midpoints fall to 5.4283, and the 32-segment water disc's fall to
 *     5.5*cos(pi/32) = 5.4736. Lip max 5.44 < water min 5.4736, so the stone
 *     covers the water's cut edge at every angle around the pond rather than
 *     beating in and out of it. Under the lip the profile turns back out and
 *     down to 5.51, which undercuts it and lays a shadow line on the water.
 *   - The outer edge reaches world 0.118 and then drops a skirt to 0.090,
 *     which passes through the cobble sheet at 0.12. That is an intersection,
 *     not a coplanar surface, so the polygonOffset hack the flat ring needed
 *     is gone with it.
 *
 * Between the two, a 340 mm flat coping at world 0.30 - 180 mm of readable
 * kerb above the paving - rolling over into a gravel apron. Max radius stays
 * exactly 7.0. One shared geometry, one instance, 637 vertices; no pointer
 * handler is on this mesh (they are on the Ducks), so nothing raycasts it.
 *
 * Traversed OUTER to INNER on purpose: LatheGeometry derives its winding and
 * normals from the order of the profile, and an open sheet walked the other
 * way faces downwards and is culled by the default FrontSide material. The
 * Blender preview cannot catch that - workbench does not backface cull - so
 * the direction is checked against three's own normals instead.

          DoubleSide because the profile reverses radial direction at the
          undercut: the inner face's normals point INWARD, the lip's point
          OUTWARD, so no single winding orients both and one of the two is
          backfacing from any given eye. Most viewpoints are fine - the inner
          face is front-facing from above ~31 deg and hidden behind the coping

 * apart in two rows and there is exactly one stall GLB. The paid answer is a
 * second and third generated markings variant; the free answer, which an earlier
 * blind A/B already demonstrated, is that a shared FRAME reads as a market
 * rather than as copy-paste as soon as the GOODS differ - so it is taken here
 * before anything is spent.
 *
 * Not a tint on the body. `Cottage.wallColor` and `ShopBuilding.wallColor` still
 * exist and still drive their fallbacks, and wiring either to a generated body
 * would multiply a hand-picked colour into an albedo that already carries one -
 * the exact double-tint CLAUDE.md records for the village cobbles. These are
 * additive meshes standing ON the counter, so the baked albedo is untouched.
 *
 * COUNTER HEIGHT IS MEASURED, NOT INHERITED. The fallback's table top sits at
 * 0.9 m, which is a fact about the PRIMITIVE. `test-results/pass6/stall-surfaces.mjs`
 * histograms up-facing triangle area by height on the shipped GLB: the generated
 * stall's counter is a 1.445 m2 spike at y 0.85, three times the next bin,
 * spanning x -0.51..0.48 and z -0.90..0.86. Everything below is placed inside
 * that rectangle and stands on that plane. Goods reach y 1.2 at most; the awning
 * underside is at 1.75, so nothing intersects it.
 *
 * All of this is plain static geometry with no injection, so `StaticMeshBatch`
 * merges it into the village batch and `applyBatchWorldSurface` finishes it -
 * these add produce to the frame, not draw calls to the budget.

 * Moulded basin for the market fountain.

 * 7 m across and 0.6 m tall, the centrepiece of the market square with four

 * silhouette. `CylinderGeometry(3, 3.5, 0.6, 32)` was a bare tapered drum: no
 * plinth, no coping, nothing for a shadow to catch on.
 *
 * The profile is a stone basin read from the bottom up: a splayed plinth whose
 * widest ring sits at y=-0.186 (world 0.114, just under the cobble sheet at
 * 0.12, so the flare washes into the paving rather than hovering above it); a
 * bowl wall with a slight entasis, slimmest at 3.11; a quirk - a recessed
 * groove at 3.13 - and then the coping springing out over it to a rolled crest
 * at 3.35 before turning in to the flat rim band. The quirk is the feature
 * that does the work at distance: it is what puts a hard shadow line under the
 * coping, and a moulding without one reads as a smooth bulge.
 *
 * The last three points dish the top face 38 mm below the rim between radius
 * 2.6 and the centre. The water sheet lies in that dish with its underside
 * open, and at 0.85 opacity the stone shows through it as apparent depth.
 *
 * Envelope: max radius 3.50, y in [-0.30, 0.30] - identical to the cylinder.
 * 627 vertices, one shared geometry on a single instance, no pointer handler.
