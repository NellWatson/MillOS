 * Windmill tower - replaces `CylinderGeometry(0.8, 1.2, 6, 20)`, a straight
 * truncated cone. Drawn once at scale 1.5, so 3.6 m across the base and 9 m
 * tall: the tallest thing in the farm and read against open sky.
 *
 * A tower mill is not a cone. Four features carry at 30 m and all four are in
 * this profile:
 *  - a splayed base course, giving a crisp ground line instead of a cut edge;
 *  - a BATTERED wall - the taper is concave, steeper at the foot and near
 *    vertical at the curb, which is what separates masonry from sheet pipe;
 *  - a corbelled reefing gallery at world y 1.86-2.06, the one horizontal break
 *    in the taper (a parapet ring above it was built and rejected on the render:
 *    shelf plus ring reads as a pipe coupling, one shelf reads as a balcony);
 *  - a curb band at world y 5.32-5.68, the ring the cap turns on and the collar
 *    the windshaft emerges from.
 *
 * The batter is load-bearing, not decoration. The blade arms sweep down to
 * world y 2.499 with their inner face at z = 0.975, and the straight cone this
 * replaces is 1.033 wide there - the sails have been passing through the
 * masonry. The battered wall is 0.901 at that height, so they now clear it by
 * 0.074 (0.11 m in world). Nothing between world y 2.5 and 6.0 exceeds 0.862.
 *
 * Envelope is identical to the cone: max radius 1.2, y in [-3, +3]. The top
 * radius is free (0.8 -> 0.64) because it is not on the envelope and is hidden
 * under the cap's underside disc; the narrower top is what turns the cap from a
 * lid into an overhanging crown.
 *
 * 34 profile points at the SAME 20 segments as before - 34 x 21 = 714 vertices
 * (LatheGeometry duplicates the seam ring, so it is points x (segments + 1);
 * the Blender harness prints points x segments and reads 34 low). Drawn once
 * for the single windmill, and it carries no pointer handlers, so it needs no
 * picking proxy.

 *
 * An ogee ("boat") cap, the English tower-mill form: a boarded fascia with a

 * where the flank turns over into the swell, then a neck, a finial ball and a

 * not a formality - the blade arms sweep vertically through the eave plane at

 * and tucks in and up immediately, reaching 0.975 at y = -0.707 against the

 *
 * 28 points at the tower's 20 segments so their facet boundaries line up at the

 * so the drip lip is a shaded ring rather than a crease. At 9 m the cap reads as

 * The swap cost this animation and has now given it back. The generated asset
 * is a single mesh whose sails are modelled continuous with the cap - welded by
 * position it is one connected shell, so there is nothing to lift out and put
 * a `ref` on - and `GeneratedWindmillBody` therefore turns the sails in the
 * vertex shader against a weight baked from the rest pose. See that file for
 * the measurements that place the hub axis and the two bands.
 *
 * `bladesRef` stays wired to the primitive, which is the only body whose blades
 * are a group the scene driver can write to. It is null whenever the GLB has
 * loaded, so the driver's write is already skipped on the shipping path.
