 * clearcoat, and metalness 1.0 is reserved for genuinely bare metal (chrome
 * bumper, exhaust stacks, wheel hubs, frame rails). With `scene.environment`
 * now bound, all of it finally has something to reflect.
 *
 * COLOUR-SPACE AUDIT: no material in this file carries BOTH a `color:` tint and
 * an albedo `map:`, so nothing here was compensating for the sRGB DataTexture
 * bug and no tint needed reverting. `tyre` keeps its dark `color:` because its
 * only map is a NORMAL map, which does not multiply albedo. The one mapped
 * material, `TruckIdentityDecals`, has no `color:` at all.

 * whole scene reflects `scene.environment` - and `WebGLRenderer` then
 * unconditionally assigns `m_uniforms.envMapIntensity.value =
 * scene.environmentIntensity` for every standard/physical material whose own
 * `envMap` is null. So on this scene `material.envMapIntensity` is a silent
 * no-op and the single global 0.30 governs every reflection. Writing one here
