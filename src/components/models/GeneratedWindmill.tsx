/**
 * The generated windmill, with its sails turning.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A GROUP WITH A `ref` ON IT. `farm/windmill.glb` is a single
 * mesh with a single material whose sails are modelled continuous with the cap:
 * welded by position it is **one** connected shell, so there is no sub-object
 * to lift out and spin. (The earlier "228 shells" reading counted components on
 * the index buffer without welding first, which splits at every UV and normal
 * seam; the welded answer is worse, not better.) A stationary windmill is the
 * most conspicuous dead animation the 30-asset swap cost, so the sails are
 * turned in the vertex shader instead, against a per-vertex weight baked from
 * the rest pose - the same thing a skin does, without a skeleton.
 *
 * WHY A WEIGHT RATHER THAN A CUT. Splitting the index buffer on a plane leaves
 * the triangles that straddle it torn open. A weight makes the seam deform
 * instead of tear, and - because the seam here is twelve vertices wide and sits
 * inside the axle boss - it deforms where nothing can see it.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE MEASURED, NOT PICKED, and
 * `__tests__/generatedWindmill.test.ts` re-derives them from the shipped GLB so
 * a regenerated asset cannot silently invalidate them:
 *
 *   - Hub axis (0.0948, 0.031) in mesh-local Y/Z, fitted by minimising the
 *     residual of the sail mass under a quarter turn - the blades' own
 *     four-fold symmetry. The area-weighted centroid puts it 0.17 m away,
 *     because the slab also catches a little of the tower base; the symmetry
 *     fit does not care about that.
 *   - The x band 0.216..0.228 sits in a valley: the whole mesh has only ~126
 *     triangles between x 0.21 and 0.23, against 4,180 in the 0.23-0.28 slab
 *     the blades occupy.
 *   - The radius band 0.55..0.57 is EMPTY. Blade mass reaches r 0.538 about the
 *     hub; the only geometry beyond it is fifteen vertices of tower plinth at
 *     r 0.585-0.600. So the two are separated by a gap rather than by a
 *     threshold through the middle of something.
 *
 * Together those give 3,915 vertices fully turning, 2,272 fully static and 12
 * blended, with every partially weighted triangle inside r 0.052 of the axle.
