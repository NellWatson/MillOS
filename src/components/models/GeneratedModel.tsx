/**
 * Per-instance variation for a cloned asset, derived from where it stands.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS ANSWERS. Both review agents named the same thing
 * independently and it was the strongest criticism either of them made: five
 * cottages, three shops, four market stalls, three Holsteins and four sheep are
 * each ONE model with ONE texture, and yaw is the only thing that differs.
 * "Three market stalls are visually identical - same awning, same crate
 * arrangement, near-same rotation. No per-instance colour, rotation or scale
 * variation anywhere."
 *
 * NOT A TINT, DELIBERATELY. `Cottage` and `ShopBuilding` still carry
 * `wallColor` props, and wiring them to the generated body would multiply a
 * baked albedo by a colour - the exact symptom-fix pattern CLAUDE.md records
 * for the village cobbles, where a `#9a9a9a` compensator was hiding a decode
 * bug. Geometry variation costs nothing and lies to no one.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC, from the call site's own position rather than `Math.random`.
 * A random draw here re-rolls on every remount, which defeats `React.memo`,
 * makes two captures of the same commit disagree, and would put a building in a
 * different place in the control arm of an A/B than in the treatment. The
 * cottage's chimney smoke already had exactly this bug and the fix was the same
 * substitution.

 * @param seed distinguishes independent channels drawn from the same position
 * @returns a stable value in [0, 1)
