/**
 * Rigged farm and village creatures.
 *
 * Nine generated, Tripo-rigged GLBs normalized by
 * `scripts/normalize-model-assets.mjs` and declared in
 * `public/models/asset-manifest.json`. One component serves all of them because
 * the generator fits the **same 41-joint skeleton with the same bone names** to
 * quadrupeds, birds and bipeds alike - a crow and a horse differ only in the
 * numbers in `CREATURE_SPECS`, not in code.
 *
 * Animation is authored here rather than baked into the assets. Tripo's
 * `animate_retarget` presets are humanoid, and because the quadruped rig names
 * the front legs `Clavicle`/`Upperarm`/`Hand`, a biped idle maps straight onto
 * one and rears the animal onto its hind legs for the whole clip. The farm has
 * no locomotion to retarget onto in any case: every animal behaviour in
 * `FarmArea.tsx` is an imperative ref nudge from the single scene `useFrame`.
 * These components therefore expose an imperative handle instead of clips, and
 * the existing drivers keep ownership of *when* an animal grazes.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * NO WORLD SURFACE TREATMENT, AND THE REASON IS THE ALIASING FLOOR
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * These nine are the last lit meshes in the world carrying no analytic surface
 * finish, and the reason they were missed is structural rather than an
 * oversight: they are `SkinnedMesh`, `StaticMeshBatch` excludes skinned meshes
 * before it reaches `isSupportedMaterial`, and nothing else applies
 * `applyWorldSurface` to a generated body. `test-results/pass6/flat-owners.mjs`
 * shows the split cleanly - every generated STRUCTURE (`pub-surface`,
 * `farmhouse-surface`, `coop-surface`, `fountain-surface`, ...) reads SHADED
 * because the batcher finishes even the candidates it declines to merge, and
 * every generated CREATURE (`cow-surface`, `sheep-surface`, `pig-surface`,
 * `chicken-surface`, `duck-surface`, `horse-surface`, `scarecrow-surface`,
 * `cat-surface`, `crow-surface`) reads flat.
 *
 * They stay flat, on measured grounds rather than on the cost of doing it:
 *
 * 1. THE MESO TERM CANNOT SURVIVE. `paddock` is the closest camera that frames
 *    them, targeting the paddock centre about 16 m out, where a metre of world
 *    covers ~35 screen px at the capture viewport. `fabric`'s 0.055 m weave
 *    lands at 1.9 px and `skin`'s 0.028 m pore at 1.0 px - both below CLAUDE.md
 *    procedural rule 5's 4-6 px floor, which makes them detail that aliases and
 *    then mips to a flat constant. Only a 0.25-0.3 m period survives, and that
 *    is a period authored for vehicle panels and hedges, not for a 1.15 m sheep.
 *
 * 2. THE MACRO TERM HAS NO CORRECT SPACE. Its value is breaking up repeats -
 *    four sheep, five chickens, four ducks - and that needs a WORLD field, one
 *    field the animals stand at different points of. But they wander: a world
 *    field on a body that translates makes the detail swim over it, which is the
 *    failure pass 4 paid for on the workers and the reason `objectSpace: 1`
 *    exists. In object space all four sheep sample the same field and get
 *    identical mottling, which is not a fix for repetition at all.
 *
 * 3. THE BAKED ALBEDO IS ALREADY THE DETAIL. `test-results/pass6/texel-density.mjs`
 *    puts these at 197-876 texels per world metre - the densest assets in the
 *    set by a wide margin, because a 0.42 m chicken carries the same 512 map as
 *    a 12 m church. An analytic field laid over that is competing with authored
 *    detail rather than supplying missing detail.
 *
 * Overturn this with a measurement, not a preference: a capture showing the
 * creatures reading flat against their surroundings at a camera that resolves
 * them would be new evidence, and a per-creature profile with a period chosen
 * against that camera's px-per-metre would be the answer.

 * Per-species reach, solved rather than guessed.
 *
 * `FarmArea.tsx`'s original grazing constant was a 0.15-0.45 rad nod tuned for a
 * rigid box head on a sphere body. Necks differ about fivefold across this
 * roster, so one number cannot serve them: on an anatomically proportioned cow
 * that value is a twitch, and on a crow it would fold the bird in half.
 *
 * These come from sweeping bend against head counter-rotation on the **shipped**
 * GLBs and taking the pose that puts the nose nearest the sward, subject to two
 * rejections that were both paid for during the trial:
 *
 * 1. **Nose behind the neck pivot.** Past a point the chain curls the head back
 *    under the chest and more bend stops being more grazing.
 * 2. **Nose below the floor.** Without that test the pig drove its snout 185 mm
 *    through the ground, because "minimise nose height" is not the same goal as
 *    "reach the grass". The target is `min(0.06, restY * 0.18)`, not zero.
 *
 * `reached` records where each nose actually ends up. The cow bottoming out at
 * 0.26 m and the horse at 0.44 m are rig limits - those necks curl rather than
 * extend - not tuning misses. In scene the grass clutter covers the gap.
