 * Compact-LOD tyre, 0.64 m across and 0.24 m wide.
 *
 * Drawn through the four-instance wheel `InstancedMesh`, so this is the only
 * round silhouette on an otherwise all-box model and the one part the eye
 * watches turn. `CylinderGeometry(0.32, 0.32, 0.24, 20)` was a bare drum: a
 * coin face-on, a sharp-cornered puck edge-on.
 *
 * Four features, all of which are still legible at 8 m (previewed at that
 * distance, and this LOD is drawn out to the 62 m tier cutoff):
 *  - a cushion-tyre tread held at full radius across the middle 128 mm,
 *  - a tight shoulder round-over in the outer 56 mm of each side, which is the
 *    single cue that separates a rubber tyre from a cut cylinder,
 *  - a rim flange stepped 14 mm proud of the wheel disc, so the tyre stands off
 *    the rim the way a bead does,
 *  - a hub pan dished 22 mm into the wheel face, which is the entire face-on
 *    read - without it the wheel is a flat disc.
 *
 * SYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE. Every wheel shares one `compactWheelOrientation`
 * quaternion, and that rotation sends the geometry's +Y face outboard on the
 * left pair and inboard on the right. One-sided detail - a hub cap on a single
 * face - would show on one side of the vehicle and be buried in the chassis on
 * the other.
 *
 * Envelope is byte-identical to the cylinder it replaces: max radius exactly
 * 0.32, which is both `FORKLIFT_WHEEL_RADIUS` (the spin integrator's divisor)
 * and the ground-contact radius, and y in [-0.12, 0.12]. The 20 radial segments
 * are carried over unchanged - the 100 mm facet argued for below still holds,
 * and the count also fixes the inscribed polygon's Z half-extent, so moving it
 * would drift the envelope on an axis nothing here needs to move.
 *
 * Designed and previewed in scripts/blender/specs/forklift-vehicles.json.
