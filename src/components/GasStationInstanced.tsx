// Every geometry in this section is module-level and drawn either through an
// InstancedMesh or as the station's one pylon, so its vertex count is a one-off
// scene cost at any instance count. No mesh in this file carries pointer
// handlers or a custom raycast, so none of them needs the picking proxy the
// corrugated silo shell does (`raycastSiloShell`, machines/CompactMachines.tsx).
//
// Profiles were designed and previewed in Blender before being transcribed -
// scripts/blender/specs/gas-station.json, run through
// scripts/blender/machine_part_preview.py. The numbers below are the ones that
// were looked at, not a retyped approximation.

/**
 * Forecourt canopy column.
 *
 * Rendered 0.5 m across and 5 m tall, four of them at (+/-6, 2.5, +/-4). The
 * previous `CylinderGeometry(0.25, 0.25, 5, 16)` was a bare tube - right
 * diameter, no story. A clad forecourt pillar has three features this profile
 * now carries, and all three survive the 11 m the pumps are seen from:
 *
 *  - a 940 mm kick skirt at full width, the scuff sleeve every real forecourt
 *    column wears. The apron plane sits at y=0.08, so 860 mm of it shows.
 *  - a chamfer and collar stepping down onto a slimmer 360 mm clad shaft. That
 *    step is what makes the skirt read as a base instead of as a ring; the
 *    first draft kept a 398 mm shaft and previewed as a dumbbell.
 *  - a conical haunch spreading back to full width at y=4.32 and holding it to
 *    y=4.40, the underside of the canopy fascia (a 0.4 m band centred on 4.6).
 *    Above 4.40 the column is inside the fascia box and invisible, so the
 *    profile spends nothing up there beyond a neck and a stub. Meeting the
 *    soffit exactly is safe here because what arrives at 4.40 is the capital's
 *    vertical wall - an edge contact, not a coplanar face. Contrast the pylon
 *    below, whose shoe ends in a horizontal annulus and so has to finish 60 mm
 *    inside the cabinet rather than flush with it.
 *
 * Envelope unchanged: max radius 0.25, y in [-2.5, 2.5], so the four instance
 * positions and the canopy slab above them need no retuning.
 *
 * The 16 segments are unchanged as well. They were raised from 8 for a
 * facet-chord reason that still holds, and re-bumping them would be a density
 * change wearing a design's clothes - the slimmer shaft improves the chord on
 * its own, from 98 mm to 70 mm. 17 x 14 = 238 vertices, shared by all four.

 * box - and the previous `CylinderGeometry(0.15, 0.15, 8, 16)` spent that whole

 *
 * A pylon reads by hierarchy, not by thickness:
 *  - a 1.12 m ground shroud at full width, the only move large enough to
 *    survive the 20-60 m this sign is actually read from;
 *  - a conical transition and collar onto a shaft that tapers 232 -> 208 mm
 *    over its run, so the pole looks carried rather than extruded;
 *  - a 340 mm mounting shoe flaring to 264 mm just under the cabinet and
 *    running 60 mm up inside it, so the shoe's top annulus is hidden instead of
 *    landing coplanar with the cabinet's underside and z-fighting it.
 *
 * Envelope unchanged: max radius 0.15, y in [-4, 4] about the mesh's y=4, so
 * the cabinet, borders and both dino logos above it stay exactly where they are.
 * 16 segments unchanged; the narrower shaft takes the facet chord from 59 mm to

// Worse, as placed it met nothing at either end: its upper end sat at
// (y 0.776, z 1.283) while the swivel it was meant to leave was at
// (y 0.55, z 1.25), so it hung 226 mm off nothing and speared straight through
// the nozzle-holder box on the way down.
//
// A hanging hose is a plane curve, which `LatheGeometry` cannot express but a
// torus arc can, and a torus arc has closed-form endpoints - so the fit is
// checked by arithmetic rather than by eye. The arc is fitted to run from the
// swivel's ferrule mouth to the top face of the nozzle handle:
//
//   start (ring angle 0)          -> y 0.5501, z 1.3400  (ferrule mouth 1.35)
//   end   (ring angle HOSE_ARC)   -> y 0.3201, z 1.5301  (handle top 1.5278)
//
// A deeper droop was tried and rejected by measurement, not taste: past ~120
// degrees the arc swings back inboard far enough to re-enter the nozzle-holder
// box (world z 1.20-1.30). At 110 degrees the hose clears the holder face by
// 8.5 mm and the pump island by 94 mm, with 350 mm of hose over a 298 mm span.
//
// This is the one part here whose envelope deliberately changes - it is a
// different curve, not a reshaped rod. The only things that position it are the
// four matrices in `pumpHoseData` below, in this file, updated in the same
// change; nothing outside this module references the hose geometry.

              THE FIELD AND THE FRAME WERE THE WRONG WAY ROUND. The orange was
              the 4 x 5 carcass and the cream was a 3.7 x 4.7 panel laid over
              it, which leaves 150 mm of orange showing as a rim: the comment
              said "orange for fun retro gas station vibe" and the sign rendered
              as a white board with a thin red edge. Swapped, so the large area
              is the brand colour and the cream is a 150 mm keyline.

              It also fixes a second fault that is not about layout. These are
              inline materials inside `FactoryExterior`'s batch root, so they
              take their finish from `resolveBatchSurfaceProfile`, which is
              blind to colour by construction and can only answer `masonry` or
              `painted`. `painted`'s macro and meso terms are authored for
              cladding and read as grey cloud on a 3.7 x 4.7 m flat panel - on
              the `forecourt` review camera the sign face was visibly grubby.
              A saturated field carries that modulation as honest weathering
              instead of as dirt on white. The real lever - letting a call site
              name the profile a BATCHED material should take, so this could ask
              for `signage` - does not exist yet; this is the third site to want
              it (see the thatch note in `utils/worldSurface.ts` and the
              outbuilding roofs in the `masonry` profile). */}

                A 0.45 m pale sphere at z +0.3 - straight at the reader - punched
                a light disc through the middle of the logo; moving it to the

                nested inside a darker one of similar radius protrudes wherever
