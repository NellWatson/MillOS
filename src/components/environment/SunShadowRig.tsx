/**
 * Sun shadow rig.
 *
 * The scene has exactly one shadow-casting light (`sun-key-light`, owned by
 * `OptimizedSkySystem`) and exactly one shadow cascade. This component decides,
 * every third frame, where that single cascade should sit.
 *
 * THREE THINGS IT HAS TO GET RIGHT, IN ORDER OF HOW BADLY THEY LOOK WHEN WRONG:
 *
 * 1. COVERAGE. Outside the orthographic box, three's shadow lookup fails its
 *    frustum test and returns *lit*. Indoors that is catastrophic rather than
 *    merely missing: the roof is two solid 60 x 100 slabs with `castShadow`, so
 *    the interior is one continuous roof shadow, and any part of the floor that
 *    falls outside the box turns into a hard-edged patch of full sunlight in the
 *    middle of a covered building. The interior box is therefore fitted to the
 *    whole envelope and pinned to the site centre, not to the camera.
 *
 * 2. TEXEL SNAPPING. A box that follows the camera re-samples the same world
 *    surface at a different sub-texel offset every frame, so every shadow edge
 *    crawls. The fix is to quantise the box centre, in light space, to whole
 *    shadow-map texels. Without it a moving camera looks worse than no shadow.
 *
 * 3. BIAS. The correct normal offset is a function of the world size of one
 *    texel, and this rig spans 90 to 220 world units on a map that may be 1024
 *    or 4096 - a 10x range. A constant `normalBias` is either acne at the wide
 *    end or peter-panning at the tight end, so it is recomputed from the fit.
 *
 * ORDERING: this component must run its `useFrame` AFTER `OptimizedSkySystem`,
 * which writes `sun-key-light.position` every frame from the solar direction.
 * It does that by being mounted after `<OptimizedSkySystem />` in
 * `OptimizedFactoryEnvironment` - R3F sorts subscribers by priority with a
 * stable sort, so equal priorities keep subscription (mount) order. A render
 * priority above 0 is NOT an option: R3F treats any non-zero priority as "the
 * app renders manually" and stops calling `gl.render` entirely.
