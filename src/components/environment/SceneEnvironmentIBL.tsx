/**
 * Scene environment (image-based lighting) and hemisphere fill.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: nothing in the scene set `scene.environment`. Every metal
 * surface in the mill - and almost everything in a mill is metal - was lit by
 * direct light alone. A metallic BRDF puts essentially all of its response in
 * the specular lobe and takes its albedo out of the diffuse term, so with no
 * environment to reflect there is nothing left but a broad ambient wash. That
 * is the whole reason the machinery reads chalky rather than metallic.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE HDRI: `public/hdri/warehouse.hdr` exists and `MillScene` already
 * mounts it behind the Ultra reflections toggle, with a note that its PMREM
 * compile costs multiple seconds. That is fine for an explicit opt-in and
 * unacceptable for the default preset. A 64 x 32 procedural equirect costs
 * microseconds to author and a single small PMREM pass to convolve, and it has
 * a property the HDRI does not: it tracks the simulated sun, so reflections
 * move with the time of day.
 *
 * ONE SET OF COLOURS FOR THREE CONSUMERS. The bands are not authored constants.
 * They are read live from the sky's own state:
 *   - top      <- `scene.background`, which `OptimizedSkySystem` keeps equal to
 *                 the sky shader's `topColor` uniform.
 *   - horizon  <- `celestial-ambient-light.color`, already lerped night to day.
 *   - ground   <- the hemisphere light's own ground colour, set below.
 * So the environment reflection, the hemisphere fill and the visible sky cannot
 * disagree at any hour: they are the same three colours.
 *
 * FLOAT, NOT BYTES. The sun disc is authored well above 1.0 so metals get a
 * specular hit with some punch. A `Uint8` texture clamps that to a flat white
 * blob. It is also why the texture is tagged Linear rather than sRGB:
 * `THREE.Color` stores linear working-space values, so the samples are written
 * through unchanged instead of being decoded a second time.
 */

/**
 * Equirectangular source resolution.
 *
 * PMREM derives its cube size from `source.width / 4`, so a 64 x 32 source
 * produced 16 x 16 cube faces. A mirror-finish metal samples near mip 0, and
 * mip 0 of a 16 x 16 face is a 5.6 degree texel: chrome came back as flat
 * colour, which is why the vehicle materials had to be roughened to 0.26 to
 * hide it. 128 x 64 gives 32 x 32 faces - 2.8 degrees per texel - which is
 * enough to resolve the 12 degree solar disc as a round highlight and the
 * horizon as a gradient rather than a step.
 *
 * NOT HIGHER. The source is three smooth latitude bands plus one soft-edged
 * disc, so it is band-limited; 256 x 128 would resolve nothing that is in the
 * signal. The write loop below is the only real cost and it quadruples with
 * each step (2048 -> 8192 pixels here, still well inside a tenth of a
 * millisecond, and it runs at most every REGENERATE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS).

/**
 * Weight of the environment - DIFFUSE **AND** SPECULAR, not diffuse alone.
 *
 * `getIBLIrradiance` returns `PI * radiance * envMapIntensity` and
 * `getIBLRadiance` returns `radiance * envMapIntensity`: one uniform scales the
 * irradiance a dielectric bounces and the reflection a metal mirrors. And
 * `scene.environmentIntensity` is that uniform for almost every material in the
 * project, because `WebGLMaterials` copies `material.envMapIntensity` into the
 * uniform only inside `if ( material.envMap )`, while `WebGLRenderer` then
 * overwrites it with `scene.environmentIntensity` for every standard material
 * whose own `envMap` is null. Set an `envMapIntensity` on a material with no
 * `envMap` and it is dead config.
 *
 * ON THE FILL SIDE, WHICH IS WHY IT IS LOW. At a typical daytime sky radiance
 * around 0.35 linear, 0.3 contributes roughly 0.33 of irradiance. Added to
 * ambient 0.22 and the hemisphere's 0.22, total fill is about 0.77 against a
 * key of 3.10 - a shade over 2 stops. Raising this is the fastest way to
 * flatten the scene straight back out, so it is deliberately lower than a
 * physically-motivated value, and `SceneEnvironmentIBL.test.ts` pins it there:
 * the fill-budget assertion caps this constant at about 0.36.
 *
 * SO METALS OPT OUT INSTEAD. A metal has no diffuse term at all - its entire
 * appearance is the environment specular - and at 0.3 every bare metal surface
 * in the mill reflected the sky at a third of the sky's own brightness. The fix
 * is not to raise this number, which would drag the diffuse fill up with it,
 * but `adoptEnvironmentMap` below: materials above `METALLIC_ENVMAP_THRESHOLD`
 * are given the PMREM as their own `material.envMap`, which makes their own
 * `envMapIntensity` live and takes them off this dampener.
