/**
 * Interior lighting.
 *
 * The building has fifteen ceiling fixtures. Every one of them was emissive
 * geometry and nothing else: a bright strip on the ceiling that put no light on
 * the floor, so the interior had no pools, no falloff between bays, and no
 * reason for the eye to read depth down the length of the hall.
 *
 * TWO PARTS, DELIBERATELY UNEQUAL:
 *
 * 1. FOUR real point lights, one per production zone. Four is a ceiling, not a
 *    budget guess. Three's forward renderer puts every point light in the
 *    uniform block of every lit material with no per-object culling, so light
 *    count is a per-fragment cost paid across the entire frame - including the
 *    exterior cameras where these contribute nothing at all. Fifteen would not
 *    hold the frame budget, and the four are placed on the zone centres so the
 *    falloff lands where the machinery is.
 *
 * 2. FIFTEEN additive floor pools, one per fixture, as a single InstancedMesh.
 *    This is what actually sells the fixture grid: the pools sit under all
 *    fifteen housings, including the x = +/-42 outer rows the point lights
 *    cannot reach, and they cost one draw call and no shader lights.
 *
 * The two are complementary. The point lights supply real falloff on geometry
 * and real shading direction; the pools supply the graphic read of a lit floor.

/**
 * The two lights `low` and `medium` keep, one per PAIR of adjacent zones.
 *
 * WHY A POINT LIGHT IS AN EXTERIOR COST AT ALL. `NUM_POINT_LIGHTS` is a program
 * define and three's forward renderer has no per-object light culling, so
 * `lights_fragment_begin` unrolls a full `RE_Direct_Physical` - GGX specular
 * plus Lambert diffuse - for every one of these on every fragment of every lit
 * material in the frame. There is no early-out around it either: the loop tests
 * `directLight.visible` only to gate a shadow lookup, never the BRDF. So on the
 * `yard`, `farm` and `overview` cameras, where the nearest of these hangs
 * inside a building whose 46-unit cutoff reaches nothing on screen, each light
 * is a per-pixel evaluation of a term that is identically zero. The scene is
 * fill-bound - the harness measures 4.0 ms for the terrain shader against zero
 * draw calls, and half the pixel count buys back 36% of the frame - so this is
 * exactly the kind of cost that shows up in the average.
 *
 * WHY NOT SWITCH THEM OFF WHEN THE CAMERA IS OUTSIDE. Because it would work,
 * and then cost more than it saved. `projectObject` collects a light only when
 * `object.layers.test(camera.layers)` passes and only when `object.visible`, so
 * either switch really does drop `numPointLights` - and `numPointLights` is in
 * the program cache key, so the old program falls to refcount zero and
 * `releaseProgram` deletes it. Every walk in or out of a doorway would then
 * recompile every material in the scene. `intensity = 0` avoids the recompile
 * and saves nothing: the light stays in the uniform block and the BRDF still
 * runs. The only recompile-safe form is a count that moves with the quality
 * tier, which already rebuilds programs at the low/medium boundary because that
 * is where `castShadow` on the sun - and therefore `NUM_DIR_LIGHT_SHADOWS` -
 * changes.
 *
 * WHAT IS TRADED. Intensity and cutoff are deliberately NOT retuned, so the
 * floor directly under a fixture is unchanged and the arithmetic below is
 * checkable without a screenshot. Two lights at the pair midpoints give about
 * half the four-light irradiance across the middle of the hall and hold the
 * zone centres at roughly the same ratio; the ends past +/-40 fall further. That
 * is a real dimming on `medium`, against ambient 0.22, hemisphere 0.22 and the
 * IBL - and still far more interior modelling than the zero point lights this
 * building had before the fixtures were lit at all. `high` and `ultra` keep all
 * four. The fifteen floor pools are untouched on every tier, and they are what
 * carries the graphic read of the fixture grid.
