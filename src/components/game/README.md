## Shared Module (shared.tsx)

Contains:
- **Announcement Data**: 150+ PA announcements organized by category
- **Event Announcements**: Safety incidents, fire drills, emergency stops
- **Dynamic Templates**: Worker/machine name injection system
- **Time-Based Announcements**: Different messages per time of day
- **Hooks**: `usePAScheduler`, `useEventAnnouncementScheduler`
- **Utilities**: Icon mapping, category colors, chaos calculation
- **Context**: `CameraFeedContext` for camera feed management

## Backward Compatibility

The original `/components/GameFeatures.tsx` now re-exports everything from this directory, so existing imports continue to work:

```typescript
// These all still work:
import { PAAnnouncementSystem } from '../components/GameFeatures';
import { GamificationBar, MiniMap } from './GameFeatures';
import { EMERGENCY_STOP_ANNOUNCEMENTS } from '../GameFeatures';
```

## Key Exports

From `index.tsx`:
- All 8 component exports
- `CameraFeedContext` and `useCameraFeedRefs`
- `SAFETY_INCIDENT_ANNOUNCEMENTS`
- `FIRE_DRILL_ANNOUNCEMENTS`
- `EMERGENCY_STOP_ANNOUNCEMENTS`
- `PA_ANNOUNCEMENT_COUNT`
- `getRandomMachineOfType`

## Design Patterns

- **React.memo**: Component optimization where appropriate
- **useShallow**: Zustand shallow equality for performance
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Lucide Icons**: Consistent icon system (no emojis)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## File Size Comparison

- **Before**: 1 file, 3,379 lines
- **After**: 10 files, average ~345 lines per component file

The shared.tsx file (2,370 lines) contains mostly announcement data arrays, which are better kept together for easier content management.
