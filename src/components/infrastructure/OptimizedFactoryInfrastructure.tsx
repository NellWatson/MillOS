/**
 * The dock safety bollard, and nothing else in this file.
 *
 * Drawn at [0.24, 1.3, 0.24] through a four-instance `InstancedMesh`: a 0.48 m
 * post standing 1.3 m out of the slab, flanking both dock approaches. It is
 * read at the range a truck or a forklift passes it - roughly 3 to 10 m - not
 * from across the site.
 *
 * It was `CylinderGeometry(1, 1, 1, 16)`, a flat-topped tube. A tube is the one
 * thing a bollard is not, and no segment count fixes that. Three features carry
 * at that range, and all three are in this profile:
 *
 *   - A GROUT COLLAR: a short vertical wall at the envelope's max radius with a
 *     chamfered top. It plants a hard horizontal line where the post meets the
 *     floor instead of letting the tube run into it.
 *   - A LONG PLAIN SHAFT, 0.392 m across and 0.73 m of it unbroken - thinner
 *     than the collar, and the step is the point. So is the length: the plain
 *     run has to dominate. Previewed with two bands spread down the shaft as
 *     well, and that reads as a fire hydrant; one band does not.
 *   - ONE BAND standing 30 mm PROUD at 70% of the height, then a seat lip under
 *     a shallow pressed dome cap. The shared safety-yellow material carries no
 *     map, so a painted stripe would be invisible - a proud band survives on the
 *     SILHOUETTE, which is the only channel this part has. A near-hemispherical
 *     cap merges with the shaft into a bullet nose, so the cap is deliberately
 *     shallow and the seat lip is what keeps it reading as a separate part.
 *
 * The profile is designed in metres and divided down, because the instance
 * scale is 5.4:1 anisotropic - a cap drawn hemispherical in unit space renders
 * as a vertical spike.
 *
 * ENVELOPE IDENTICAL to the cylinder it replaces: radius 1.0 at the collar rim,
 * y in [-0.5, 0.5]. Every instance matrix and neighbour relationship is
 * untouched, and the shaft narrowing to 0.392 m mates with nothing - the nearest
 * portal jamb is 2.2 m away.
 *
 * 20 segments is a multiple of 4, so a vertex lands on each of +/-X and +/-Z and
 * the post measures its nominal radius in plan; it also holds the flat-of-facet
 * error on the shaft to 2.4 mm. One shared module-level geometry behind one
 * `InstancedMesh`, so 357 vertices (up from 100) is a one-off scene cost at any
 * instance count. The mesh carries no pointer handlers and no custom raycast, so
 * no picking proxy is needed - compare `raycastSiloShell` in
 * `machines/CompactMachines.tsx`, where densifying a picked mesh cost 6.6 ms.

/**
 * SURFACE TUNING NOTE (re-authored against the rebalanced lighting).
 *
 * The shell was authored when fill and key were within 2% of each other and
 * there was no `scene.environment`. Two consequences drove every value below.
 *
 * 1. METALNESS. Painted cladding, coated roof deck, painted structural steel
 *    and painted handrail are all DIELECTRICS. They were carrying 0.07 / 0.09 /
 *    0.15 / 0.30 - the physically invalid band where the BRDF has neither a
 *    full diffuse albedo nor a real specular, which reads chalky. They are now
 *    0. The only genuine metals left in the shell are the galvanised gallery
 *    deck and the extruded fixture housings, and with the IBL present those two
 *    now have something to reflect.
 *
 * 2. THE FAKE FILL. `wall`, `wallUpper` and `roof` each carried an
 *    `emissive: '#253238'-ish` at intensity 0.08-0.09. That is 0.003 linear -
 *    it was never doing the job it was added for, and it tinted every shadowed
 *    face teal. Removed outright; the interior is lit by the four zone lights,
 *    the ambient/hemisphere terms and the IBL instead.
 *
 * Sunlit exterior faces are almost exactly as bright as before (key 1.84 ->
 * 3.10 against fill 1.46 -> 0.44 very nearly cancels at cos ~ 0.9), so the
 * facade colours move only slightly. Interior faces lost roughly half their
 * fill, so the surfaces the interior camera sees - slab, lower wall, deck -
 * are lifted to compensate.

   * Slender members (trusses, eave trim, standing seams). No panel relief: a
   * grid tiled onto a 0.18 m deep member is sub-pixel noise, not detail.
   *
   * AUDITED AND LEFT FLAT ON PURPOSE - re-checked 2026-08-17, because this is
   * the branch's largest untextured entry by a wide margin (3,488 m summed
   * world size over 87 instances, next entry 976 m) and a work list ordered by
   * that number puts it first. Three reasons it stays:
   *
   * 1. THE METRIC REWARDS LENGTH, NOT AREA. `worldRadius` is the geometry
   *    radius times the largest scale axis, which is what three itself uses for
   *    culling - so a 120 x 0.18 x 0.22 m batten scores as though it were 104 m
   *    across. Seventy-eight of these 87 instances are the roof standing seams,
   *    which are 0.45 m wide. Their summed EXTENT is enormous and their surface
   *    is not.
   * 2. THEY ARE ALREADY THE DETAIL. The seams exist so the roof deck stops
   *    reading as a painted rectangle, and the comment on `roofDetails` records
   *    that they were widened to 0.45 m specifically to survive SMAA at the
   *    overview camera's 74 m. Confirmed in that frame: they read as lines.
   *    Texturing them is texturing the texture.
   * 3. NO SINGLE TILING CAN BE CORRECT. `InstancedBoxes` draws every instance
   *    from one shared `UNIT_BOX`, so a `band()` repeat stretches with each
   *    instance's scale - and this set spans 118 x 0.3 x 0.3 trusses, 120 x
   *    0.18 x 0.22 eave trim, 5 x 1 x 3 roof units and the battens. That is
   *    over 300:1 of aspect variation against one UV layout. It is the same
   *    constraint `ChamferStrip` below documents for geometry.
   *
   * The same three apply to `accent` (facade sills and headers, 0.55 m bands),
   * `galleryRail` (0.14 m tube, 43 m runs sharing a set with 1.45 m stanchions)
   * and `fixtureHousing`. `glass`, `skylight`, `fixtureGlow` and the walkway
   * paint are flat by construction - glazing, an unlit lens and a transparent
   * marking have nothing for a surface map to do.

// WHAT THIS OVERTURNS, AND ON WHAT GROUNDS. The comment on `steelTrim` above
// audited this branch on 2026-08-17 and left it flat DELIBERATELY, giving three
// reasons: the work-list metric rewards length rather than area, the seams are
// already the detail, and - the decisive one - no single UV tiling can serve an
// instanced set spanning over 300:1 of aspect variation from one shared
// `UNIT_BOX`.
//
// All three still stand, and none of them is an argument against THIS. A
// world-space analytic field is sampled in metres, not in UV, so it does not
// stretch with an instance's scale: the 118 m truss and the 0.14 m rail tube cut
// from the same unit box each receive detail at its own correct density. That is
// exactly the constraint the earlier audit could not get past, so the closure is
// reopened on new grounds rather than re-litigated on the old ones. No `map:` is
// added to any material here; the reasons those slots are empty are unchanged.
//
// COST. Every material below is consumed by `InstancedBoxes`, and
// `StaticMeshBatch` excludes `InstancedMesh` outright
// (`inspectStaticBatchObject`: `exclude('instanced')`), so attaching a shader
// costs no batching and no draw call - the same reasoning `FarmArea.tsx` records
// for the crop's wind shader.
//
// DATUMS. `machineSurfaces` had to learn this the hard way: a grime gradient
// measured from world zero saturates to nothing on anything standing on an
// elevated floor, and a term that evaluates to nothing still reports as a
// finished surface in every gate. The sifter gallery deck sits at y 8.62 with a
// 0.46 m slab, so its walking surface is 8.85 and its rails stand on that.
