/**
 * Terrain-owned procedural surface textures.
 *
 * WHY THESE LIVE HERE AND NOT IN `src/textures/`
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * `src/textures/*` is the shared library consumed by machines, walls, village
 * and farm. Everything in this file is specific to the unified terrain shader:
 * the packing layout, the height-field centring and the tileability guarantees
 * below only make sense for `TerrainMaterial`. Keeping them local means the
 * terrain can change its packing without re-tuning twenty other materials.
 * The albedo maps the terrain shares with the rest of the site (grass, tarmac)
 * are still consumed from `PROCEDURAL_TEXTURES` - only the terrain-specific
 * surface data is generated here.
 *
 * PACKING (`*Surface` textures, RGBA, linear / NoColorSpace)
 *   R = tangent-space normal X, biased to 0..1
 *   G = tangent-space normal Y, biased to 0..1
 *   B = roughness
 *   A = surface height, re-centred so the channel mean is 0.5
 *
 * Ambient occlusion is NOT stored: the shader derives it from the height
 * channel, which is exactly what a separate channel would have contained. One
 * RGBA tap therefore yields normal + roughness + AO + blend height, which keeps
 * the terrain inside a comfortable fragment sampler budget. The height channel
 * is mean-centred on 0.5 for two reasons: the shader's AO remap must be
 * non-linear or the average texel would be occluded, and the height blend
 * compares the four channels against each other, which is only meaningful when
 * they share a datum. See TerrainMaterial.tsx.
 *
 * Note the shader samples these by hand, so the "roughness must be written to
 * green / metalness to blue" rule for three's built-in `roughnessMap` and
 * `metalnessMap` slots does not apply here - nothing in this file is ever
 * assigned to one of those slots.
 *
 * TILEABILITY IS MANDATORY HERE
 * The shared generators use `fbmNoise`/`voronoi`, which are not periodic, so a
 * tile boundary carries a small albedo discontinuity. That is tolerable in an
 * albedo map and fatal in a height/normal map: a seam becomes a hard lighting
 * line repeated every 6.5 world units. Every generator below therefore uses the
 * periodic `tileFbm` / `tileVoronoi` helpers and wraps its central differences.
