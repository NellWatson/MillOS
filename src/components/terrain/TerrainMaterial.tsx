/**
 * TerrainMaterial - Custom material with splat map-based blending
 *
 * Extends MeshStandardMaterial to blend 4 terrain types based on a
 * splat map texture. Each RGBA channel controls blend weight for:
 * - R: Grass
 * - G: Asphalt
 * - B: Road
 * - A: Dirt / gravel verge
 *
 * This eliminates z-fighting because there's only ONE surface.
 *
 * COLOUR SPACE CONTRACT (read before touching the albedo path)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * Every albedo texture handed to this material is tagged SRGBColorSpace by
 * `createColorDataTexture`, so the GPU decodes it on sample and `uXColor` is
 * already in linear working space. There is deliberately NO sRGB decode in
 * this shader: adding one would double-correct and the ground would go black.
 * The per-channel colour uniform is a TINT that multiplies the albedo tap, so
 * feeding it the same hue the texture already carries applies that hue twice -
 * which is exactly the bug that made the grass a dark, oversaturated green.
 * See TERRAIN_TINTS in terrainTypes.ts.
 *
 * SURFACE DATA
 * The `*Surface` textures pack tangent-normal XY, roughness and height into
 * one RGBA tap each (see terrainTextures.ts). AO is derived from height in
 * the shader. Everything is gated on `uHasSurfaceMaps`, a uniform float, so
 * the `low` tier pays exactly what it paid before and no new #define - and so
 * no new program variant - is introduced.
 *
 * FRAGMENT TAP BUDGET (per fragment, pure grass - most of any exterior frame)
 *   low     2  splat + grass albedo
 *   medium  4  splat + grass albedo + grass surface + macro (far only)
 *   high    5  ... + macro (near)
 *   ultra   5
 * Worst case, a fragment sitting on a four-way region transition, is 11 on
 * high/ultra and 10 on medium.
 *
 * Every gate in this shader is a REAL branch, not a multiply by zero: a
 * multiply still issues the sample and pays for it in full. `uHasSurfaceMaps`,
 * `uMacroAmount`, `uMacroNearAmount` and the `uHasXTexture` flags are uniforms,
 * so those branches are coherent across the whole draw and the sample is
 * genuinely never issued. The per-channel `weights.X > EPS` gates are
 * data-dependent but screen-space coherent, because splat regions are painted
 * at full intensity with edges only a few units wide. Do not "simplify" any of
 * these into arithmetic.
