/**
 * Render Layer Constants
 *
 * This module provides centralized constants for preventing z-fighting
 * across the MillOS 3D scene. All floor overlays, decals, and transparent
 * surfaces should use these constants.
 *
 * Z-FIGHTING PREVENTION TECHNIQUES:
 * 1. Y-Offset: Raise geometry above floor by increasing amounts
 * 2. PolygonOffset: Bias depth buffer sampling
 * 3. RenderOrder: Control draw order independent of depth
 * 4. DepthWrite: Disable for transparent overlays
 *
 * @example
 * // Floor overlay positioning
 * <mesh position={[x, FLOOR_LAYERS.safetyMain, z]}>
 *
 * @example
 * // Material with polygon offset
 * <meshBasicMaterial
 *   polygonOffset
 *   polygonOffsetFactor={POLYGON_OFFSET.standard.factor}
 *   polygonOffsetUnits={POLYGON_OFFSET.standard.units}
 *   depthWrite={false}
 * />
