/**
 * Colour Grade Constants
 *
 * Single source of truth for the display pipeline: the tone curve, the grade
 * that follows it, the vignette, bloom, and the ambient-occlusion parameters.
 *
 * Two consumers read these values and they must agree, because they sit on
 * opposite sides of the same image:
 *   - `App.tsx` configures the WebGLRenderer (the no-composer path, used by the
 *     `low` tier and by any frame rendered before the composer mounts).
 *   - `PostProcessing.tsx` configures the EffectComposer (every other tier).
 *
 * Duplicating a number across those two files is how the two paths drift, so
 * neither file is allowed to hold a literal.
 *
 * NOTE ON IMPORTS: this module deliberately imports only `three`. It is pulled
 * in by `graphicsStore.ts`, which is eager, whereas `postprocessing` is loaded
 * lazily with `PostProcessing.tsx`. Importing `postprocessing` here would drag
 * the whole effect library into the main bundle, so the `ToneMappingMode`
 * enum is mirrored numerically below and locked to the library by a unit test.

// === TONE CURVE ===

/**
 * Renderer-side tone mapping operator.
 *
 * Khronos PBR Neutral. Chosen over ACES and AgX because 41 call sites across
 * 18 live files set `toneMapped={false}` - dominated by the sky ShaderMaterial
 * and the celestial/basic materials in `OptimizedSkySystem.tsx`. That flag is
 * inert inside the composer, so all of those authored-for-display colours get
 * tone mapped for the first time the moment any effect is enabled. Neutral
 * subtracts an offset of at most 0.04, is pass-through until peak 0.76, then
 * rolls off with 0.15 desaturation - a far smaller delta on display-referred
 * input than AgX, which log2-maps [-12.47, +4.03] EV and would visibly mud the
 * authored sky.
 *
 * AgX (`TONE_MAPPING_MODES.AGX` / `THREE.AgXToneMapping`) is the intended
 * endpoint once the sky and celestial materials are re-authored scene-referred.
 * At that point it should land as an explicit `ultra` opt-in, not a default.
