/**
 * World surface treatment: the analytic finish for authored primitive surfaces.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A TEXTURE
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * The measured work list this repo steers by (`audit-scene-models.mjs`, FLAT
 * MATERIALS BY WORLD SIZE) has had the same three rows at the top for three
 * passes:
 *
 *     MeshStandardMaterial #ffffff   3953 m   217 meshes   499 inst
 *     factory-trim                   3488 m     2 meshes    87 inst
 *     factory-accent                  762 m     1 mesh       8 inst
 *
 * Every previous pass reached for a texture and stopped, for three reasons that
 * are all correct and all recorded in the source:
 *
 * 1. NO SINGLE TILING CAN BE CORRECT. `InstancedBoxes` draws every instance
 *    from one shared `UNIT_BOX`, so a UV repeat stretches with each instance's
 *    scale. `factory-trim` alone spans 118 x 0.3 x 0.3 trusses, 120 x 0.18 x
 *    0.22 eave trim and 5 x 1 x 3 roof units - over 300:1 of aspect variation
 *    against one UV layout. `vehicleSurface.ts` documents the same constraint
 *    for the trucks, and `ChamferStrip` for geometry.
 *
 * 2. THE BIG ROW IS NOT A MATERIAL. `MeshStandardMaterial #ffffff` is the
 *    output of `StaticMeshBatch.createMergedGeometry`; the real colours ride a
 *    `color` attribute. There is no source material to texture - there are 579
 *    material elements in `FactoryExterior.tsx` and 492 in `TruckBay.tsx` that
 *    feed it.
 *
 * 3. A SHADER ON A SOURCE MATERIAL DESTROYS BATCHING.
 *    `StaticMeshBatch.isSupportedMaterial` rejects any material carrying an own
 *    `onBeforeCompile` or `customProgramCacheKey`. `FactoryExterior.tsx` says
 *    so at its GRAVITY WEATHERING block and chose decal quads instead; so does
 *    `FarmArea.tsx` ("Do NOT do this to a building material"). Both are right.
 *
 * This module is the move all three of those constraints point at and none of
 * them took: attach the finish to the material the BATCHER PRODUCES, in world
 * and object space rather than UV space, with no texture taps at all.
 *
 *   - Zero draw-call cost. The injection lands after the merge, so nothing is
 *     evicted from a batch. The bounded worst case the predecessor measured for
 *     the texture route - +139 calls out of 1,227, 11% - is not spent.
 *   - Zero VRAM. Analytic noise, no texture unit, no upload, no mip chain.
 *   - Scale invariant. A 120 m batten and a 0.3 m bolt cut from the same unit
 *     box both get metre-correct detail, because the field is sampled in metres
 *     and not in UV.
 *
 * WHAT THIS OVERTURNS, DELIBERATELY. Pass 3 closed `world-factory-infrastructure`
 * and `authored-village` as JUDGED rather than as work lists, and the judgement
 * was sound on the evidence available: no UV tiling can serve that instanced
 * set, so "add the missing map" was the wrong instruction. A world-space field
 * is precisely the thing that defeats that objection, so those closures are
 * reopened here on new grounds rather than re-litigated on the old ones. The
 * reasons those materials have no `map:` still stand and no `map:` is added.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * COORDINATE SPACES, AND WHY EACH TERM USES THE ONE IT DOES
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * | term  | space                  | why                                      |
 * |-------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
 * | macro | field (world or object)| metre-scale tonal drift                   |
 * | meso  | field (world or object)| material-scale break-up and relief        |
 * | grime | WORLD Y minus a datum  | height above the floor it stands on       |
 * | dust  | WORLD normal Y         | which way is up, at any height            |
 * | edge  | VIEW normal + position | silhouette curvature proxy                |
 *
 * The FIELD space is selected per profile, and this is the part that is easy to
 * get wrong. A world-space field on a static building is what makes two copies
 * of the same prefab stop reading as two copies. The same field on a WALKING
 * WORKER makes the detail swim: the field is nailed to the world and the body
 * moves through it. Anything that translates, rotates or deforms therefore
 * samples in OBJECT space, which is welded to the body - the same choice
 * `vehicleSurface.ts` made for the trailers' ribs, for the same reason.
 *
 * Object space is taken from `position`, not from `transformed`. For a
 * `SkinnedMesh` `transformed` is the DEFORMED position, so a field sampled
 * there would slide over the mesh as the clip plays; `position` is the rest
 * pose and stays put. That also sidesteps the reason `world-personnel` has had
 * no albedo for four passes - `SharedWorkerMaterials` records that the GLB
 * unwrap spans roughly U/V [-1.0, 1.5] with no atlas intent, so no map can be
 * bound to it. A rest-space field needs no unwrap at all.
 *
 * INSTANCING. `transformed` does NOT carry `instanceMatrix` - three applies it
 * inside `<project_vertex>`, at the point this injects - so the object matrix is
 * composed explicitly and the same material gives the same answer on a `Mesh`
 * and on an `InstancedMesh`.
 *
 * WORLD NORMAL. `mat3( modelMatrix ) * objectNormal` is wrong here because it
 * drops `instanceMatrix`, and these instanced sets are non-uniformly scaled per
 * instance, which would point the up-facing dust mask sideways.
 * `transformedNormal` has already been through three's per-instance
 * inverse-transpose and the normal matrix, leaving it in VIEW space; multiplying
 * on the right by `mat3( viewMatrix )` is the transpose, which returns it to
 * world space. `machineSurfaces.ts` documents the same manoeuvre.
 *
 * WORLD POSITION IS RECOMPUTED, never taken from `<worldpos_vertex>`: that chunk
 * is guarded by `USE_ENVMAP || DISTANCE || USE_SHADOWMAP || USE_TRANSMISSION ||
 * NUM_SPOT_LIGHT_COORDS > 0`, so on the `low` tier - no shadow maps - reading
 * `worldPosition` is a COMPILE ERROR and the surfaces go black. That failure is
 * already written up in `machineSurfaces.ts`; it is repeated here because this
 * module reaches far more materials than that one does.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE GROUND DATUM IS A PARAMETER, BECAUSE A SATURATED SMOOTHSTEP IS INERT
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * `machineSurfaces` measures grime from `uMachineDeck` rather than zero because
 * the plansifters stand on the elevated floor at y = 9, where a zero-datum
 * `smoothstep` saturates and the whole grime term silently evaluates to
 * nothing. The surfaces this module reaches span the yard at y = 0, walkway
 * decks, the factory roof around y = 15 and the village. Every profile
 * therefore carries its own datum, and the two terms that must still work at
 * height - dust and edge wear - are deliberately datum-free.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * HOW A CHANGE HERE IS VERIFIED
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * `audit-scene-models.mjs` CANNOT verify this module. It classifies a mesh as
 * finished when `material.shaderInjected` is true, so attaching any injection
 * removes these rows from the work list whether or not a pixel changed. An
 * inert treatment and a working one score identically there.
 *
 * `scripts/measure-surface-contrast.mjs` is the paired control. Every material
 * here shares ONE `uSurfStrength` uniform object, so the treatment switches off
 * between two frames of the same render - one page load, one variable - and the
 * script reports the changed-pixel fraction and the local-contrast ratio inside
 * the changed region. An exactly-zero changed fraction means the term is not
 * there. Read a green audit as evidence of nothing.
 *
 * CACHE KEY. One fixed literal for every profile, versioned by hand. The
 * profiles differ only in UNIFORM VALUES, so they must share one program: three
 * folds the parameter defines into the key alongside this string, so
 * USE_INSTANCING / USE_COLOR / shadow permutations still split properly.
 * NEVER put `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` in it - that recompiles the program
 * every frame, which is a documented 60-recompiles-per-second bug in this repo.

   *   `terrain/TerrainMaterial` - the site's grass is not flat and has not been
   *     for some time. It carries a 175-unit macro control map (dry / soiling /
   *     hue) plus a dedicated grass tile-break in that map's alpha, on every
   *     tier, with a second 38-unit rotated tap on high and ultra; the splat
   *     shader also binds a packed grass surface map for normal, roughness and
   *     cavity AO from medium up. A second macro field on top would double-dip
   *     the term this profile exists to supply, and the injection would be
   *     declined anyway. This closes the "grass is one flat colour plus a tiled
   *     texture" reading on new grounds rather than re-litigating it.

 * emissive, and roughness/metalness rounded to the nearest quarter. That is the
 * exact set on which the representative genuinely does speak for the group.
 *
 * The cost of the blindness is that `vegetation` and `signage` can never be
 * chosen here. Both are almost entirely out of the batcher's reach anyway -
 * foliage is `InstancedMesh` or transparent, and the mill's signage is unlit
 * `MeshBasicMaterial` - and all three are excluded from batching by
 * construction. Where a batched surface genuinely wants one of those profiles,
 * the owning branch should apply it at the material instead of hoping the
 * batcher guesses.

/**
 * Finish a mesh the batcher DECLINED, in place.
 *
 * `applyBatchWorldSurface` reaches only the materials `StaticMeshBatch`
 * PRODUCES. Everything it excluded - `InstancedMesh`, and anything under a
 * dynamic or interactive ancestor - keeps its own material and, until this
 * existed, kept no finish either. `test-results/pass7/unfinished-models.mjs`
 * measures that gap at roughly 200 m spread across `authored-factory-exterior`,
 * `authored-truck-yard`, `authored-village-site` and `authored-farm-site`, in
 * hundreds of inline JSX `meshStandardMaterial` elements that no per-site edit
 * could reach at a sensible cost.
 *
 * THE COLOUR-AWARE RESOLVER IS THE RIGHT ONE HERE, and that is the whole
 * difference from the batch path. `resolveBatchSurfaceProfile` is deliberately
 * blind to colour because a merge group's representative speaks for a group
 * whose members' colours differ and ride a vertex attribute. A declined mesh is
 * a SINGLE-MATERIAL SITE: its `color` is the colour of its surface, which is
 * exactly the case `resolveSurfaceProfile` documents itself for. So a hedge
 * gets `vegetation` and a chevron gets `signage` here, neither of which the
 * batcher can ever choose.
 *
 * Every existing guard still applies and none is duplicated: transparent,
 * sub-unit-opacity, emissive and unlit materials are declined by
 * `isOutOfSurfaceScope`, and anything already carrying an injection - its own
 * or this module's - is declined by `applyWorldSurface`. Returns the profile it
 * applied, or null, so the caller can tally what it actually reached.
