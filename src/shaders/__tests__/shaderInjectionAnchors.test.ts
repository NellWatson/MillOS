/**
 * Shader-chunk anchor contract.
 *
 * Every `onBeforeCompile` injection in this repo works by string-replacing a
 * three.js shader chunk include:
 *
 *   shader.fragmentShader = shader.fragmentShader.replace(
 *     '#include <fog_fragment>',
 *     `...injected GLSL...`
 *   );
 *
 * `String.prototype.replace` returns the subject unchanged when the pattern is
 * absent. So if the anchor is misspelled, or three renames or removes the chunk
 * in an upgrade, the injection silently does nothing: no exception, no warning,
 * the material simply renders without the feature. Nothing else in the toolchain
 * catches this — GLSL is a string, so typecheck, eslint, the jsdom test
 * environment (no WebGL) and the production build all pass on an anchor that
 * matches nothing.
 *
 * This test pins every `#include <...>` anchor used as a replace() target
 * against the chunks three actually ships, so a broken or renamed anchor fails
 * here instead of quietly removing a visual feature at runtime.
