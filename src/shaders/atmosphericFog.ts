/**
 * Atmospheric fog: exponential-squared, height-attenuated, far-plane safe.
 *
 * WHY A GLOBAL CHUNK OVERRIDE RATHER THAN PER-MATERIAL PLUMBING
 *
 * Fog is evaluated on every lit surface in the scene, and those surfaces are
 * authored across a dozen files owned by different systems. Threading a new
 * uniform through all of them is both a large diff and a permanent maintenance
 * tax: a material added later silently opts out. Three.js composes fog from
 * four named chunks, so replacing those chunks reaches every fog-enabled
 * material - stock and custom - for one edit and zero uniforms. Every constant
 * below is baked into the GLSL as a literal for exactly that reason.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHANGES, IN ORDER OF HOW MUCH IT MATTERS
 *
 * 1. EXPONENTIAL-SQUARED INSTEAD OF LINEAR. `THREE.Fog` ramps linearly between
 *    `near` and `far` and then CLAMPS at 1.0. With the shipping clear-weather
 *    values (175 / 350) that put the site perimeter at radius 255 on a fog
 *    factor of 0.46 and everything past 350 on a flat 1.0: the whole middle
 *    distance converged to one blue-white wash and stopped carrying depth.
 *    `FogExp2` asymptotes instead - at density 0.0020 the same 255 reads 0.23,
 *    so distant geometry keeps roughly three quarters of its own albedo and
 *    silhouettes separate again.
 *
 * 2. HEIGHT ATTENUATION. Haze is a ground-hugging layer, so a rooftop at y=32
 *    should not haze like the slab at y=0. `FOG_HEIGHT_FALLOFF` gives a scale
 *    height around 71 world units, floored by `FOG_HEIGHT_FLOOR` so tall
 *    geometry never punches out to a hard, unhazed silhouette.
 *
 * 3. RADIAL DISTANCE, NOT VIEW-SPACE Z. Three.js ships `vFogDepth = -mvPosition.z`,
 *    which is the depth-buffer coordinate rather than the distance light
 *    actually travelled. At this scene's 97-degree horizontal field of view a
 *    fragment at the edge of the frame is 50 degrees off axis, so its z is only
 *    0.64 of its true distance and it receives roughly a third less haze than a
 *    fragment the same distance away in the centre. That is visible here and
 *    not subtle: the far ground pokes over the mountain ring at the left of the
 *    overview frame and, under z-based fog, stayed saturated green while the
 *    same terrain in the middle of the frame had faded out. `length()` costs one
 *    inverse square root per vertex and removes the artefact entirely.
 *
 * 4. A FAR-PLANE GUARD, WHICH IS NOT A NEW EFFECT BUT A PRESERVED CONTRACT.
 *    The camera far plane is 360 (`constants/renderLayers.ts`), and the world
 *    is larger than that: from the `overview` camera the far rim of the ground
 *    disc sits about 413 units away and is clipped. That clip is invisible
 *    today only because the linear fog reached a saturated 1.0 at 350 and the
 *    fog colour is kept equal to the sky's horizon colour, so the clipped edge
 *    faded into the sky before it could be seen. `FogExp2` has no far cutoff
 *    and would have exposed a hard geometry edge through 40% haze. The guard
 *    re-establishes the old guarantee - full extinction before the frustum cuts.
 *    Because `vFogDepth` now carries radial distance and the frustum clips on
 *    view-space z, and z is never greater than radial distance, the guard is
 *    guaranteed to have saturated by the time anything reaches the far plane,
 *    at every angle across the frame.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH: the fog COLOUR, which `OptimizedSkySystem` owns and
 * drives per frame from the sky's horizon colour plus a sun-direction inscatter
 * term. This module only decides how much of that colour a fragment receives.

/**
 * ONE VARYING: THE VIEW-SPACE POSITION. Distance and height are both derived
 * from it in the fragment stage, and both have to be, for different reasons.
 *
 * DISTANCE MUST BE PER FRAGMENT. Three ships `vFogDepth = -mvPosition.z`, a
 * per-vertex scalar, and that is only safe because view-space z IS linear in
 * world space, so the rasteriser's perspective-correct interpolation
 * reconstructs it exactly. Radial `length()` is NOT linear, so interpolating it
 * per vertex is wrong by however coarse the mesh is - and this scene has a
 * ground plane spanning about 510 units with vertices only at its corners.
 * Every corner is 300 to 400 units out, so the interpolated "distance" under
 * the camera came out around 400 and the entire low-tier ground rendered as
 * flat fog colour. Verified by capture, not by reasoning: the missing terrain
 * in the low-quality overview shot was the ground at fogFactor 1.0.
 * Interpolating the view-space POSITION and taking its length in the fragment
 * shader is exact everywhere, because position is linear in world space.
 *
 * HEIGHT MUST BE RECOVERED FROM mvPosition, not from `modelMatrix *
 * transformed`: instancing, skinning and batching are all applied after
 * `begin_vertex`, so the model matrix alone does not describe where the vertex
 * ended up. `mvPosition` is the one value correct and in scope in every
 * standard vertex shader. A view matrix is rigid, so its rotation R is
 * orthonormal and R^-1 = R^T; the y component of the world-space offset is
 *   (R^T v).y = sum_j R[j][y] * v[j]
 * which in GLSL column-major terms is dot(vec3(m[0].y, m[1].y, m[2].y), v).
 * Adding the camera's own world height completes the reconstruction.
 * `viewMatrix` and `cameraPosition` are both declared in three's fragment
 * prefix, so this works in the fragment stage without extra plumbing.
